  <md:abstract>This is one of the modules in a collection titled "Programming Oldies But Goodies" that gathers many of my tutorials in their original HTML format into a common location to make them readily available for Connexions users. The contents of these modules cannot be downloaded from cnx.org in PDF format. However, the original HTML files along with image files and other support files can be downloaded in the cnx offline.zip format.</md:abstract>

<para id="p1000">
Over the years, I have published a large number of tutorials in the areas of computer programming and 
	digital signal processing (DSP). As I have time available, I am converting the more significant of those tutorials into cnxml code and re-publishing them at cnx.org.

that gathers many of the tutorials in their original HTML format into a common location to make them readily available for Connexions users.



</para>




<para id="p1002">
The tutorials linked to this module cannot be downloaded from cnx.org in PDF format. However, the original HTML files along with image files and other support files 
can be downloaded in the Connexions offline.zip format.

</para>




<para id="p1003">
Some of the tutorials may require source code that is defined in other 
tutorials. I have attempted to make certain that all of the source code required 
by all of the tutorials listed below is included in this module. However, if one 
of these tutorials refers to another tutorial or to a program that is not 
included, try searching for it by title on cnx.org or on the web. It is 
probably available somewhere.

</para>




<para id="p1004">
Many of the tutorials will contain internal links to other tutorials that I 
have written and published somewhere on the web. Those links may, or may not 
still be good. In any event, if you search cnx.org for the tutorial by title or 
by topic, you will probably find a clean copy of the tutorial on cnx.org.
