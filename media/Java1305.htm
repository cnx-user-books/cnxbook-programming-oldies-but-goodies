<a NAME="Preface"></a>Preface</h2></center>
This is one in a series of lessons designed to teach you about Sun's Enterprise
JavaBeans(TM) technology, often referred to simply as EJB.&nbsp; <i>Enterprise
JavaBeans(TM)</i> is a trademark of Sun.
<p>This lesson and the next two lessons constitute a three-part miniseries
designed to provide background information, and to explain where EJB fits
in the grand scheme of things at Sun.
<p>Subsequent lessons will show you how to write, deploy, and execute enterprise
beans.

<h2>
<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2></center>
<b><font color="#FF0000">Preview</font></b><b><font color="#FF0000"></font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">This lesson will introduce you to the world of
enterprise data processing, Enterprise JavaBeans(TM), and Sun's Java 2
Platform Enterprise Edition, often referred to simply as J2EE.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">I will explain the difference between Enterprise
JavaBeans(TM) and JavaBean Components(TM).</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">The lesson will venture into the world of multi-tier
systems (I will have much more to say about this topic in future lessons).</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">A couple of real-world examples of multi-tier
systems will be cited in the form of the ubiquitous ATM and the gasoline
pump that accepts credit card payments.</font><b><font color="#FF0000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Enterprise JavaBeans(TM) and JavaBean Components(TM)</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">Because of the likelihood of confusion regarding
the use of the term <i>beans</i>, I will begin by telling you that an EJB
is not a <i>JavaBean Component(TM)</i>, as discussed in my series of <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/7077/scoop/onjava.html">tutorial
lessons</a> beginning with lesson number 500.</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">What is a JavaBean Component(TM)?</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">Briefly, a <i>JavaBean Component(TM)</i> is reusable
compiled code that is intended to be combined with other JavaBean components
in a visual development tool.&nbsp; For example, most of the Java AWT and
Swing GUI components are JavaBean Components(TM).</font>
<p><font color="#000000">While JavaBean Components(TM) may have some functionality
on the server when used in conjunction with servlets and JSP, they are
probably best suited for and most commonly used on the client side.</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">So, what is an EJB?</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000"><i>Enterprise JavaBeans(TM)</i> consist of reusable
compiled code that is designed to be installed inside a special application
server that is compliant with Sun's <i>Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition</i>.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">More specifically, EJBs are reusable compiled
software components intended for use in the middle tier of multi-tier enterprise
software systems.&nbsp; They have no applicability on the client tier of
the multi-tier system (although one EJB can function as a client to another
EJB).</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">First cousins</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">While enterprise beans and JavaBean Components(TM)
are definitely cousins, and both are intended to provide reusable software
components, they are very different.&nbsp; Don't let the similar names
confuse you.</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Use of Bean in this lesson</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">Now that you know that there is a difference,
I will have nothing more to say about JavaBean Components(TM) in this lesson.&nbsp;
From this point forward in this lesson, when I refer to <i>beans</i>, I
will be referring to Enterprise JavaBeans(TM).</font>
<center>
<h2>
<a NAME="Java 2 platform, Enterprise Edition"></a><font color="#000000">Java
2 Platform, Enterprise Edition</font></h2></center>
<font color="#000000">Enterprise JavaBeans(TM) technology is part of a
larger overall software development technology from Sun known as the Java
2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE).</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Why use J2EE?</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">One of the main goals of J2EE is to make it possible
for the enterprise software developer to reduce development cost and reduce
time-to-market response time.</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Enterprise software requires many services</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">Enterprise software typically needs to provide
a variety of services to customers, partners, employees, and suppliers.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">In many cases, the software that provides these
services must combine existing information systems with new business requirements
to deliver the required services to a broad range of users.</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">What does Sun say about the required services?</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">According to Sun, these services need to be:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000"><i>Highly available</i>, to meet the needs of today's
global business environment.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000"><i>Secure</i>, to protect the privacy of users and
the integrity of enterprise data.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000"><i>Reliable and scalable</i>, to insure that business
transactions are accurately and promptly processed.</font></li>
</ul>
<b><font color="#FF0000">Multi-tier systems</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">In today's world, systems for delivering these
services are usually built as distributed systems consisting of several
tiers or layers.&nbsp; Such systems usually include a client tier, a back
end data storage tier, and one or more tiers in the middle to implement
business logic and processes.</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">The Automatic Teller Machine (ATM)</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">For example, the ubiquitous ATM serves as the
client tier in certain banking systems.&nbsp; There are probably layers
in the middle that communicate with the ATM, and interpret and process
the information that flows from and to the ATM.&nbsp; Certainly there is
a back-end tier where the information about your bank balances is stored
on a (hopefully) persistent basis.</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Most development is at the middle tiers</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">According to Sun, the majority of application
development work on enterprise systems is done in the middle tiers.&nbsp;
Therefore, in order to leverage software development dollars, we need to
make the development of software in the middle tiers as straightforward
and productive as possible.</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Automatic gasoline pumps</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">The automatic gasoline pumps that process credit
cards on the driveway in front of the convenience store probably represent
the front end or client tier of another form of multi-tier system.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">As these automatic gasoline pumps evolve (to allow
you charge a car wash in addition to the gasoline, for example), the software
in the middle tier must be upgraded to accommodate new features.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">However, it is not likely that modifications would
be required in the back-end data storage simply to accommodate the fact
that the gasoline pump now knows how to sell a car wash in addition to
selling gasoline.&nbsp; Hopefully, that back-end data system, which stores
your credit card balances, is solid as a rock and only rarely modified.</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Reducing cost and complexity of development</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">J2EE is designed specifically to accommodate the
need to productively develop and upgrade the software in the middle tier
of a multi-tier system.&nbsp; The design is intended to reduce the cost
and complexity of developing and upgrading multi-tier capability.&nbsp;
The intent is to make it possible to quickly deploy and enhance new capability
in response to competitive pressures.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">According to Sun, <i>"The middle tier shields
the client tier from the complexity of the enterprise and takes advantage
of rapidly maturing Internet technologies to minimize user administration
and training."</i></font>
<center>

<h2>
<a NAME="Where To From Here"></a>Where To From Here?</h2></center>
This lesson has been very general in nature.&nbsp; The next lesson will
become a little more specific with respect to a discussion of Sun's J2EE.
<p>In addition to Enterprise JavaBeans(TM), other Java components such
as servlets, Java Server Pages (JSP), and JDBC are part of J2EE.&nbsp;
I have already published a large number of lessons on servlets, JSP, and
JDBC.&nbsp; You will find links to those <font color="#000000">tutorial
lessons</font> on my <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/7077/scoop/onjava.html">personal
web site</a>.
