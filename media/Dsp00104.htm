<a NAME="Preface"></a>Preface</h2></center>
This is one in a series of lessons designed to teach you about
Digital Signal Processing (DSP) using Java.&nbsp; The purpose of the miniseries
is to present the concepts of DSP in a way that can be understood by persons
having no prior DSP experience.&nbsp; However, some experience in Java
programming would be useful.&nbsp; Whenever it is necessary for me to
write a program to illustrate a point, I will write it in Java.

<p>I will explain the meaning of sampling, and will explain some of the problems 
that arise when sampling and processing analog signals.&nbsp; Those problems 
generally relate to the relationship between the sampling frequency and the 
high-frequency components contained in the analog signal.</p>
<p>I will explain the concept of the Nyquist folding frequency, which is half 
the sampling frequency.</p>
<p>I will illustrate the frequency folding phenomena by plotting sampled time 
series data as well as spectral data.</p>

<h2>
<a NAME="Discussion and Sample Programs"></a><font color="#000000">Discussion</font></h2></center>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Sinusoids, time series, composition, and 
decomposition</b></font></p>
<p>I introduced you to sinusoids and  sampled time 
series in an earlier lesson.&nbsp; I taught you about sine and cosine functions, 
and the Java methods used to calculate their values.&nbsp; I also introduced  the concepts of period and frequency for sinusoids.</p>
<p>While introducing decomposition, I told you that almost everything we will discuss in this series on DSP is 
based on the premise that every time series can be decomposed into a large number of 
sinusoids, each having its own amplitude
and frequency.</p>
<p>I also introduced  the concept of composition, where any time series can be 
created by adding together the correct set of 
sinusoids, each having its own amplitude and frequency.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The notion of sampling analog signals</b></font></p>
<p>While signal processing can be accomplished in a variety of ways, including 
analog processors, digital processors, and optical processors, DSP is based on the notion that signals in nature 
can be sampled and converted into a series of numbers.&nbsp; The numbers can 
 
be fed into some sort of digital device, which can process the numbers to 
achieve some desired objective.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>What is meant by sampling?</b></font></p>
<p>To sample a signal means to measure and record its amplitude at a series of 
points in time.&nbsp; For example, you might record the temperature in your 
office every ten minutes for twenty-four hours.&nbsp; In this case, the actual 
temperature in your office would be the analog signal.&nbsp; The 144 temperature values that you 
record would be a sampled time series intended to represent that analog signal.&nbsp; </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Uniform sampling is most common</b></font></p>
<p>Although uniform sampling is not strictly necessary, the most common practice is 
to sample the signal at uniform intervals of time, <i>(such as once every ten 
minutes, once per second, or one-thousand times per second).</i>&nbsp; This results 
in a uniform sampling frequency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>(Most of the discussions in this series of tutorials on DSP will assume a 
uniform sampling frequency.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Some problems arise</b></font></p>
<p>While sampled data can be used to simulate most of the signal-processing 
capabilities available with analog devices, the process of sampling does 
introduce some complications that must be dealt with.&nbsp; For the most part, 
these complications have to do with the relationship between the sampling 
frequency <i>(in samples per second)</i> and the highest frequency component 
contained in the signal <i>(in cycles per second).</i></p>
<p>Stated simply, if the analog signal contains any sinusoidal components whose 
frequency is greater than half the sampling frequency, then those components 
will appear in the sampled time series at a different frequency.&nbsp; This can 
result in a variety of problems.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Reconstruction of the analog signal</b></font><p>
Theoretically, if the sampling frequency is twice the highest frequency 
component contained in the analog signal, then the samples can be used in 
conjunction with an analog filter to reconstruct the original analog signal.<blockquote>
<p><i>(However, this requires the construction of a perfect analog filter.&nbsp; In practice, the sampling frequency needs to be perhaps 
ten times the highest frequency component in the analog signal to make it 
practical to do a good job of reconstructing the analog signal from the samples.)</i></blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Reconstruction is not always required</b></font><p>Once the signal has been sampled and converted to 
digital form, there is often no  interest in reconstructing the analog signal 
from the samples.&nbsp; While this eliminates the difficulty of reconstruction, 
it doesn't eliminate the potential problems caused by having the sampling 
frequency be less than twice the highest frequency component in the signal.<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The Nyquist folding frequency</b></font><p>
If the analog signal contains frequency components that 
are greater than half the sampling frequency, those components will appear to be at a 
different frequency in the sampled data.<p>
The frequency that is equal to half the sampling frequency is 
often referred to as the <i>Nyquist folding frequency</i>, or simply the <i>folding 
frequency.</i>&nbsp; The folding frequency is half the sampling frequency.&nbsp; 
I will provide examples later  to illustrate where this frequency gets its 
name.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>A brief description</b></font><p>If a frequency 
component in the analog signal is less than the sampling frequency, but exceeds 
the folding frequency by an amount <i>d,</i> it will 
appear in the sampled data at a frequency that is the folding frequency minus <i>d.</i><p>In other words, the 
entire frequency spectrum appears to fold around the folding 
frequency such that all frequency components that are above the folding 
frequency fold down to a similar position on the lower side of the folding frequency.&nbsp; 
Those frequency components above the folding frequency produce a mirror image 
below the folding frequency.<blockquote>
<p><i>(If a frequency component in the analog signal is greater than the 
sampling frequency, folding still occurs, but in a more complicated way.)</i></blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Some specific numbers</b></font><p>Some specific numbers may make this 
easier to understand.&nbsp; Assume that 
the sampling frequency is 2000 samples per second, giving a folding frequency of 
1000 cycles per second.<p>If an analog signal contains a frequency component at 
1100 cycles per second, it will fold down and appear at 900 cycles per second in 
the sampled signal.<p>A frequency component at 1600 cycles per second in the 
analog signal will  fold down and appear at 400 cycles per second in the 
sampled signal.<p>A frequency component at 2000 cycles per second <i>(the 
sampling frequency)</i> will fold down and appear at zero frequency in the 
sampled signal.<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>A few comments about sampling</b></font><p>
The folding behavior is fairly easy to illustrate graphically, and I will do 
that shortly.&nbsp; Before doing that, however, I need to make a few comments 
about what it really means to sample an analog signal.<p><font color="#FF0000">
<b>What do we really have?</b></font><p>First we need to think 
about what we really have when we have a sampled time series.&nbsp; All 
that we really have is a set of values taken at specific times.&nbsp; In reality, we 
know nothing about the values that actually existed for the analog signal 
in-between the samples.<p>For example, in the temperature experiment described 
earlier, when we record the temperature once every ten minutes, we can't really 
say what values we would have recorded if we had recorded the temperature once 
every five minutes instead.&nbsp; Therefore, we sometimes find ourselves 
estimating what the values are  between the recorded samples.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Sampled sinusoids</b></font><p>Consider the 
five plots shown in Figure 1.<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00104figa.gif" width="401" height="429"><p align="center">
Figure 1 Samples from five different sinusoids<p>Figure 1 shows the values for 
samples taken from five different sinusoids <i>(the height of each vertical bar 
represents the value of a sample).</i><p>All five sinusoids were sampled at the 
same sampling frequency.&nbsp; The sinusoid in the center was sampled 
twenty times per cycle <i>(not necessarily twenty times per second).</i>&nbsp; <p>
The two sinusoids above the center had higher frequencies than the sinusoid in 
the center, with the sinusoid at the top having the highest frequency.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
For a fixed sampling frequency, the sinusoids above the center had fewer samples 
per cycle than the sinusoid in the center.&nbsp; The sinusoid at the top had the 
fewest number of samples per cycle.<p>The two sinusoids 
below the center had lower frequencies, than the sinusoid in the center, with 
the sinusoid at the bottom having the lowest frequency.&nbsp; The two sinusoids 
below the center had more samples per cycle than the sinusoid in the center.&nbsp; 
The sinusoid at the bottom had the most samples per cycle.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>The number of samples per cycle is important</b></font><p>
In the final analysis, what really counts is not the number of samples per 
second of the sampling frequency, or the number of cycles per second of the 
signal frequency.&nbsp; What really counts is the number of samples per cycle of 
the highest frequency component.&nbsp; This value is established by the 
combination of the signal frequency and the sampling frequency.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>The values between the samples</b></font><p>Because the 
plots in Figure 1 are 
pure sinusoids, I can  mathematically determine the values between the samples.&nbsp; 
However, if there had been the slightest amount of random noise superimposed on the 
sinusoids, <i>(which is the more realistic situation),</i> I would have no way of knowing 
the values  between the samples.&nbsp; Thus, all of the information that I 
have about these five signals is contained in the heights of the vertical bars 
shown in Figure 1.<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Estimating the values in between 
the samples</b></font><p>As mentioned earlier, we often find ourselves estimating 
the values in between the samples.&nbsp; One way to do this is shown in Figure 
2, which shows a different graphical treatment for the same five sinusoids.<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00104figb.gif" width="401" height="431"><p align="center">
Figure 2 Rectangular representations of samples from five sinusoids<p>
Figure 2 represents each of the sample values as a rectangle.&nbsp; In effect, 
this treatment estimates that there is no change in the value of the analog signal 
for half a sample interval after the sample is taken.&nbsp; Then the value of 
the analog signal jumps to the value of the next sample.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>A more common representation</b></font><p>
Now consider the graphical treatment for the same five sinusoids shown in Figure 
3.<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00104figc.gif" width="401" height="431"><p align="center">
Figure 3 Trapezoidal&nbsp;representations of samples from five  sinusoids<p>Figure 3 shows a more common representation of the data.&nbsp; 
Figure 3 treats each sample as a trapezoid consisting of a rectangle and a right 
triangle.&nbsp; The triangle sets atop the rectangle and connects each sample 
value to the next with a straight line.<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The most 
common representation</b></font><p>Now consider the most common representation 
of the sampled data, as shown in Figure 4.<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00104figd.gif" width="401" height="431"><p align="center">
Figure 4 Most common representations of samples from five sinusoids<p>Figure 4 shows the most common representation of the sampled data.&nbsp; 
Figure 4 is the same as Figure 3 except that the vertical lines that identify 
the sides of the trapezoids have been omitted.&nbsp; In Figure 4, each sample 
value is connected to the next sample value with a straight-line segment.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>What happens when the sampling frequency is reduced?</b></font><p>As 
you can see in these figures, regardless of which graphical treatment you use, 
the sampling frequency relative to the signal frequency is sufficiently high to 
present a respectable view of the sinusoidal signals.&nbsp; Now I'm going to 
show you what happens when the sampling frequency is reduced without changing 
the frequency of the sinusoids.<p>Figure 5 shows 
the same five sinusoids as above, except that they are plotted across a longer 
period of time.&nbsp; <i>(The presentation in Figure 5 treats each sample as a 
rectangle.)</i><p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00104fige.gif" width="401" height="431"><p align="center">
Figure 5 Five sampled sinusoids<p>In particular, you should note the obvious frequency 
difference between the top sinusoid and the bottom sinusoid.&nbsp; Also note the 
frequency difference between the two sinusoids immediately above and immediately below the 
center sinusoid.<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Some numbers</b></font><p>Let's put some numbers to the frequencies involved.&nbsp; If 
we consider the sampling frequency to be 20 samples per second, 
then the center sinusoid has a frequency of one cycle per second, with 20 
samples per cycle.&nbsp; On that basis, the frequencies of the sinusoids from 
top to bottom are as shown below:<p>1.75 cycles per second<br>
1.50 cycles per second<br>
1.00 cycles per second<br>
0.50 cycles per second<br>
0.25 cycles per second<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Comparison of frequencies with 
center frequency</b></font><p>The most important thing to note about these 
frequency values is how the four outer frequencies relate to the center 
frequency.&nbsp; The top and bottom frequency values differ from the center 
frequency by 0.75 cycles per second.&nbsp; In other words, the frequency of the 
top sinusoid is 0.75 cycles per second above the frequency of the center 
sinusoid, and the frequency of the bottom sinusoid is 0.75 cycles per second 
below the frequency of the center sinusoid.<p>Similarly, the second and fourth frequency values differ 
from the center frequency by 0.50 cycles per second.&nbsp; Again, one is above 
and the other is below.<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Reduce the sampling frequency</b></font><p>What I am going to do now is to recalculate and re-plot the values for 
each sinusoid at a sampling frequency of two samples per second instead of 20 
samples per second.&nbsp; This will place the frequency of the center sinusoid 
exactly at the folding frequency of one cycle per second.&nbsp; More 
importantly, 
this will place the frequencies of the top two sinusoids above the folding 
frequency.<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Re-plot the sampled data</b></font><p>I will 
re-plot the data for each sinusoid across the same period of 
time as in Figure 5.&nbsp; The results are shown in Figure 6.&nbsp; It would 
probably be useful for you to view Figures 5 and 6 side-by-side in separate 
browser windows.<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00104figf.gif" width="401" height="431"><p align="center">
Figure 6 Result of re-sampling the five sinusoids<p>There are several important 
things to note about Figure 6.<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Center plot no longer 
resembles a sinusoid</b></font><p>First, you will probably notice that the 
plot for the center sinusoid no longer looks much like a sinusoid.&nbsp; 
Rather, it looks like a square wave.&nbsp; This is the result of having exactly 
two samples per cycle of the sinusoid.&nbsp; One sample is taken from the 
positive lobe of the sinusoid, and the next sample is taken from the negative 
lobe of the sinusoid.&nbsp; This pattern repeats, producing something that looks 
like a square wave.&nbsp; <i>(A different graphical treatment would make it look 
like a triangular wave.)</i><p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The 
top two sinusoids</b></font><p>More important, however, is 
to note what has happened to the top two sinusoids.&nbsp; Because the 
frequencies of the top two sinusoids are above the folding frequency, they no 
longer have a minimum of two samples per cycle.&nbsp; Thus, the apparent 
frequency of these two sinusoids has folded around the folding frequency and 
appears as a lower frequency.<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Top sinusoids match 
bottom sinusoids</b></font><p>In fact, the plot of the top sinusoid now looks 
exactly like the plot of the bottom sinusoid at a frequency of 0.25 cycles per 
second.&nbsp; This means that the energy in the top sinusoid at 1.75 cycles per 
second has folded into a new frequency of 0.25 cycles per second.<p>The plot of the sinusoid immediately above the center looks exactly 
like the plot of the sinusoid immediately below the center at a frequency of 
0.50 cycles per second.&nbsp; This means that the energy in that sinusoid at 
1.5 cycles per second has folded into a new frequency of 0.5 cycles per second.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Bottom three plots are correct</b></font><p>The plots of the center sinusoid and the two 
sinusoids below the center are still correct <i>(although not very well 
sampled).</i>&nbsp; However, the frequency information embodied in the top two 
sinusoids has been lost.&nbsp; The top two sinusoids appear to be at a different 
frequency than the actual frequency of the corresponding analog signals.&nbsp; 
The fact that the frequencies of these two sinusoids were originally 1.75 and 
1.50 cycles per second is now lost in the sampled data.<p><font color="#FF0000">
<b>A different approach</b></font><p>Now I'm going to illustrate the same 
folding phenomena from a different perspective using spectral analyses.&nbsp; 
First I will show you a case having no sampling problems.&nbsp; Then I will 
introduce a sampling problem and show you the impact that the problem has on the 
final results.<p>Figure 7 shows the result of performing spectral analyses on 
five different sinusoids <i>(not the same five as in the previous discussion).</i>&nbsp; Each plot in Figure 7 shows the spectrum of a 
different sinusoid.&nbsp; The spectrum is computed and displayed from zero 
frequency on the left to the folding frequency on the right.<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00104figh.gif" width="401" height="430"><p align="center">
Figure 7 Spectral analyses of five sinusoids with no sampling problems<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Sampling frequency was four samples per second</b></font><p>
The sampling frequency for the data in Figure 7 was four samples per second, giving a 
folding frequency of two cycles per second.&nbsp; Thus, the horizontal scale on 
each plot represents the frequencies from zero on the left to two cycles per 
second on the right.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>The five sinusoids</b></font><p>
Starting at the top, each of the five plots represents the frequency spectrum of 
a sinusoid 
having the amplitude and frequency shown in the following table.<br>

<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>The heights of the spectral peaks</b></font><p>
The height of each spectral peak in Figure 7 is consistent with the amplitudes of the 
sinusoids given in the table.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>The locations of the spectral peaks</b></font><p>
The spectral peaks  in Figure 7 appear where you would expect to 
see them.&nbsp; For example, the location of the peak in the first plot 
corresponds to a frequency of 0.25 cycles per second within a total frequency 
range extending from zero to two cycles per second.&nbsp; This matches the 
information given in the above table for the first sinusoid.<p>
The location of the spectral peak in the fifth plot corresponds to a frequency 
of 1.75 cycles per second within a total frequency range extending from zero to 
two cycles per second.&nbsp; This matches the information given in the above 
table for the fifth sinusoid.<p>The location of the peak in each of the three plots 
between the first and the last are correct for the frequency of the sinusoid 
involved.<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Introduce a sampling problem</b></font><p>
Now I will introduce a sampling problem by keeping the frequencies of the 
sinusoids the same and reducing the sampling frequency from four samples per 
second to two samples per second.&nbsp;  <p>
The result of this change is shown in Figure 8.<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00104figg.gif" width="401" height="431"><p align="center">
Figure 8 Spectral analyses of five sinusoids with sampling problem<p>
As before, each of the plots in Figure 8 shows the frequency spectrum of an 
individual sinusoid.&nbsp; The spectrum is plotted from zero frequency on the left to the folding frequency on 
the right.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Sampling frequency was two samples per second</b></font><p>
In this case, the sampling frequency was two samples per second, giving a 
folding frequency of one cycle per second.&nbsp; Therefore, the horizontal scale on 
each plot represents the frequencies from zero on the left to one cycle per 
second on the right.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>The heights of the spectral peaks</b></font><p>
Once again, the height of each spectral peak is consistent with the amplitude of 
the sinusoid.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>The locations of the spectral peaks</b></font><p>
As before, the spectral peaks in the first three plots appear where you would expect to 
see them.&nbsp; The peak in the first plot is about twenty-five percent of the 
way across the total spectrum, corresponding to 0.25 cycles per second.<p>
The spectral peak in the second plot is at the center, corresponding 
to 0.5 cycles per second.&nbsp; The third peak is in the correct location for 
0.75 cycles per second.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>A problem with the location of two spectral peaks</b></font><p>
However, a problem exists with the spectral peaks in the last two plots.<blockquote>
  <p>
<i>(I marked the two problem peaks with a red oval to make it obvious which 
ones I am talking about.&nbsp; You may find it helpful to compare Figure 8 
side-by-side with Figure 7.)</i></blockquote>
<p>
The spectral peak in the fourth plot also appears about midway  between 
zero and one cycle per second.&nbsp; This indicates that the corresponding 
sinusoid had a frequency of 0.5 cycles per second.<p>
However, the frequency of the sinusoid for the fourth plot was 1.50 cycles per second, 
not 0.5 cycles per second as indicated.&nbsp; 
Thus, that spectral peak should have been off the scale on the right-hand side of the 
plot.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>The folding frequency</b></font><p>
Recall, however, that the right edge of the plot is the folding 
frequency.&nbsp; Therefore, any spectral components that should appear to the 
right of 
the folding frequency fold around and appear to the left of the 
folding frequency.&nbsp; Therefore, the spectral peak in the fourth plot, which should 
appear at 0.50 cycles per second above the folding frequency,  appears 
instead at 0.50 cycles per second below the folding frequency.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>The peak in the fifth plot</b></font><p>
Similarly, the frequency of the sinusoid for the fifth plot was 1.75 cycles per 
second.&nbsp; The peak for this sinusoid should have appeared 0.75 cycles per 
second above the folding frequency, but appeared instead 0.75 cycles per second 
below the folding frequency.&nbsp; In other words, the spectrum folded around 
the folding frequency so that this peak appeared below the folding frequency.<p>
I am going to show you two more views of the spectra of these sinusoids to help 
you better understand the folding phenomena.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Back to the case with no problems</b></font><p>
Let's go back and examine another view of the case that has no sampling problems.&nbsp; 
This view is shown in Figure 9.<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00104figi.gif" width="401" height="430"><p align="center">
Figure 9 Spectral analyses of five sinusoids with no sampling problems<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Sampled at four samples per second</b></font><p>
This is the case where all five sinusoids are sampled at a sampling frequency of 
four samples per second, resulting in a folding frequency of two cycles per 
second.&nbsp; If you compare Figure 9 with Figure 7, you will see that the left 
half of Figure 9 is very similar to Figure 7.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Figure 9 shows twice the frequency range</b></font><p>
In Figure 7, the spectral data was computed and displayed from zero frequency on 
the left to the folding frequency <i>(two cycles per second)</i> on the right.&nbsp; 
In Figure 9, the spectral data was computed and displayed from zero frequency on 
the left to the sampling frequency <i>(four cycles per second)</i> on the right.<p>
Thus, the total frequency range for Figure 9 is twice the frequency range for 
Figure 7.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Folding frequency at the center</b></font><p>
In Figure 9, the folding frequency is exactly in the center of each plot.&nbsp; 
In other words, the center of the plots in Figure 9 corresponds to the right 
edge 
of the plots in Figure 7.&nbsp; Everything to the left of center in Figure 9 
corresponds to the plots in Figure 7.&nbsp; The material to the right of center 
in Figure 9 was not shown in Figure 7.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Why is it called the folding frequency?</b></font><p>
Hopefully the display in Figure 9 will explain why the frequency that is half 
the sampling frequency is called the folding frequency.&nbsp; The computed spectrum folds 
around that frequency.&nbsp; Everything to the right of the folding frequency is 
a mirror image of everything to the left of the folding frequency.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Peaks below folding frequency are valid</b></font><p>
All the peaks to the left of center in Figure 9 are valid spectral peaks 
associated with the corresponding sinusoids.&nbsp; However, all the peaks to the 
right of center, which I marked with red ovals, are artifacts of the sampling 
process.&nbsp; Those peaks do not exist in the true spectrum of the original raw 
data.&nbsp; They were created by the sampling process.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Normally don't compute the mirror image</b></font><p>
Normally we don't worry about this mirror image above the folding frequency when 
doing spectral analyses.&nbsp; We know it is there and we simply ignore it.&nbsp; <p>
In fact, for reasons of economy, when doing spectral analyses using discrete 
Fourier transforms, we usually don't even compute the spectrum at frequencies 
above the folding frequency.&nbsp; Since it is always a mirror image of the 
spectrum below the folding frequency, we know what it looks like without even 
computing it.<br>

<font color="#FF0000"><b>What happened to the peak structure</b></font></p>
<p align="left">In 
case you are wondering why the peaks in Figure 9 have less structure than the 
peaks in Figure 7, this is because the points at which I computed the spectral 
data in Figure 9 were twice as far apart as the points at which I computed the 
spectral data in Figure 7.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><i>(The total frequency range in Figure 9 is twice as wide as in Figure 7, 
  but I computed the same number of points in both cases.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Although it's not obvious at this plotting scale, there are zero-valued 
points between the side lobes on the peaks in Figure 7.&nbsp; The points in the 
spectra of Figure 9 simply missed the side lobes and hit the zeros between the 
side lobes.&nbsp; I will have a lot more to say about this in a future lesson 
discussing spectral analysis.</td>

<font color="#FF0000"><b>Now for the sampling problem</b></font><p>
Now let's take another look at the case with the sampling problem.&nbsp; This is 
the case where the sampling frequency was reduced from four samples per second 
to two samples per second but the frequencies of the sinusoids was not changed.&nbsp; 
This view of the problem is shown in Figure 10.&nbsp; It will probably be useful 
for you to compare Figure 10 with Figure 8.<p align="center">

Figure 10 Spectral analyses of five sinusoids with sampling problem<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Folding frequency is at the center</b></font><p>
As with the previous case, each of the plotted spectra in Figure 10 shows the 
frequency range from zero frequency to the sampling frequency of two samples per 
second.&nbsp; The folding frequency of one cycle per second appears in the 
center of each plot.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Peaks to left correspond to Figure 8</b></font><p>
The peaks to the left of center in Figure 10 correspond to the peaks in  Figure 8.&nbsp; Because the right edge of Figure 8 is the folding frequency, the 
peaks to the right of center in Figure 10 don't appear in Figure 8.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>A mirror image</b></font><p>
As is always the case, everything to the right of the folding frequency in Figure 10 is a 
mirror image of everything to the left of the folding frequency.<p>
I have identified the 
artifacts created by the sampling process with a red oval in Figure 10.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Raw data frequency exceeds folding frequency</b></font><p>
The problem, as you will recall, is that the frequency of the sinusoids 
corresponding to the two bottom plots in Figure 10 is above the folding 
frequency.&nbsp; Thus the peaks to the right of center in the bottom two plots 
of Figure 10 actually represent the frequencies of the corresponding sinusoids.<p>
Unfortunately, these two peaks appear to the right of the folding frequency, 
which the area of the spectra that we normally ignore.&nbsp; <p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Artifacts to the left of the folding frequency</b></font><p>
Furthermore, these two peaks are reflected through the folded mirror image process into 
the area to the left of the folding frequency.&nbsp; For these two sinusoids, 
the peaks to the left of the folding frequency are artifacts, and I have 
identified them as such with ovals.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Normally can't identify artifacts</b></font><p>
I am able to identify these two peaks as artifacts only because I know the true 
frequency makeup of the raw data.&nbsp; In most real-world situations with 
unknown data, there would be no way for me to identify these particular peaks to 
the left of the folding frequency as artifacts.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Illustrates the folding frequency</b></font><p>
Hopefully this illustration will make the concept of the folding frequency 
easier for you to understand.&nbsp; The folding frequency is one-half the sampling 
frequency.&nbsp; The entire spectrum below the folding frequency folds around 
the folding frequency and the peaks in that spectrum appear in mirror-image 
format above the folding 
frequency.<p>
The frequency information for all frequency components above the folding 
frequency is lost when the signal is sampled.&nbsp; In addition, the energy 
associated with those components will fold around and can corrupt the 
information for frequency components that are below the folding frequency.<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>The bottom line</b></font><p>The 
bottom line  is that you must be very careful when sampling analog 
signals for later processing using DSP.&nbsp; In order to avoid 
erroneous results, you must sample sufficiently fast to ensure that your 
sampling rate is greater than twice the highest frequency components contained in the 
analog signal.<p>On the other hand, the greater your sampling rate, the more 
computer-intensive will be most of the DSP techniques that you  apply to the 
data later.&nbsp; For economy reasons, therefore, you don't want your sampling frequency to be 
excessively high.<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Using an analog low-pass filter</b></font><p>A common approach to sampling is to feed the analog signal into 
an analog-to-digital <i>(AtoD)</i> converter.&nbsp; This is a device that 
measures  the amplitude of the analog signal at a uniform sampling 
frequency.&nbsp; It is common practice to place a low-pass analog filter immediately ahead 
of the converter to suppress any analog frequency components that are greater 
than one-half the sampling frequency.<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Digital 
re-sampling</b></font><p>Another common approach is to initially sample 
the analog signal at a sufficiently high rate to ensure that the sampling rate 
is greater than twice the highest frequency contained in the analog signal.&nbsp; 
Then, if you really don't need all of that high-frequency information, you can 
apply a low-pass digital filter to suppress the high-frequency energy.&nbsp; 
Then you can re-sample the data to a lower sampling frequency simply by 
discarding samples.&nbsp; The data with the lower 
sampling frequency can then be used for further DSP analysis.<center>

<a NAME="Summary"></a>Summary</h2></center>
I explained the meaning of sampling, and explained some of the problems that 
arise when sampling and processing analog signals.<p>The problems generally 
relate to the relationship between the sampling frequency and the high-frequency 
components contained in the analog signal.</p>
<p>I explained the concept of the Nyquist folding frequency, which is half the 
sampling frequency.</p>
<p>I illustrated the frequency folding phenomena by plotting sampled time series 
data as well as spectral data.</p>
