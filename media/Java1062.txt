In the previous lesson, Baldwin introduced you to a very useful 
program that displays information about any Java component, 
including inheritance, interfaces, properties, events, and 
methods.  In this lesson, Baldwin explains how the GUI for this 
program is set up using JFrame, JPanel, JTextArea, JScrollPane, 
JTextField, JButton, and JLabel components.
