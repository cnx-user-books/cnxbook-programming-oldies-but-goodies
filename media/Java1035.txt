Baldwin develops three convenience methods that provide the functionality of glue and struts.  These methods can be used as alternatives to the factory methods of the Box class used for similar purposes.  They differ from the factory methods in several important respects.  One of the methods makes it possible to produce an elastic spacer component (glue) with an upper limit on how far the component will stretch.  Another method returns a reference to an object that provides the functionality of glue and struts in a single object.
