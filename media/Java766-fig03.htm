information about their bean may provide a&nbsp;
BeanInfo class that implements this BeanInfo&nbsp;
interface and provides explicit information about
the methods, properties, events, etc, of their bean.&nbsp;

A bean implementor doesn't need to provide a
complete set of explicit information. You can pick
and choose which information you want to provide
and the rest will be obtained by automatic analysis
using low-level reflection of the bean classes'&nbsp;
methods and applying standard design patterns.

You get the opportunity to provide lots and lots&nbsp;
of different information as part of the various&nbsp;
XyZDescriptor classes. But don't panic,
you only really need to provide the minimal core
information required by the various constructors.&nbsp;

See also the SimpleBeanInfo class which provides
a convenient "noop" base class for BeanInfo&nbsp;
classes, which you can override for
those specific places where you want to return
explicit info.&nbsp;

To learn about all the behaviour of a bean see&nbsp;
the Introspector class."
