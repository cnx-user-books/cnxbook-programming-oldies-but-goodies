Baldwin shows you how to use custom methods that provide the functionality of glue and struts.  One of the methods produces an elastic spacer component with an upper limit on how far the component will stretch.  Another method provides the functionality of glue and struts in a single object.  Just for fun, Baldwin also shows you how to use a JButton as a container.
