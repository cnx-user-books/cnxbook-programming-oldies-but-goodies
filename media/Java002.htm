<p>I cannot overemphasize the importance of Sun's Java documentation  to
aspiring Java programmers.&nbsp; The documentation package, which can be
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html#docs">downloaded</a>
for installation and local access, or accessed <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/index.html">online </a>contains
   a wealth of information.<br>
      </p>
           
<blockquote><i>(Note that each time Sun releases a new version of the SDK,
   they also release a correspondingly new version of the documentation.&nbsp; 
 Therefore, as new versions are released, the above links will not take you
 to the latest version  of the documentation.)</i></blockquote>
           
<p>Since 1997, I have published several hundred Java tutorial lessons on
<a href="http://softwaredev.earthweb.com/java">Gamelan.com</a> and on my
web site at <font color="#000000"><a href="http://www.DickBaldwin.com">www.DickBaldwin.com</a>.</font>&nbsp; 
People often ask me how I have learned so much about Java without ever  having 
attended a training course on Java.&nbsp; The answer is simple. &nbsp;I  am
completely self-taught insofar as Java is concerned.&nbsp; Virtually everything 
 that I know about Java, I have learned by studying Sun's Java documentation, 
 and by experimenting with the information that I found there. &nbsp;Virtually 
everything that you need to know about Java is provided by Sun in their documentation 
package.<br>
      </p>

<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Small core language, large class library</b></font><br>
      </p>
           
<p>The Java programming environment consists of a small core programming
language and a large class library.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
       
<blockquote><i>(As of the date of this writing, you can view <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/j.title.doc.html">The
   Java Language Specification</a> online.&nbsp; This specification will
tell    you just about everything that most programmers need to know about
the core   language.)</i><br>
      </blockquote>
              
<p>The size of the class library grows with the release of each new version
  of the SDK, because each new version provides capabilities that didn't
exist   in the previous version.&nbsp; New capabilities are added through
the addition   of new classes and new interfaces to the library.<br>
      </p>
           
<p>For example, the documentation for the J2SE 1.4.1 API alone consists of
  more than 6500 hyperlinked HTML files.&nbsp; The complete documentation
package&nbsp;for  J2SE 1.4.1 consists of more than 8200 hyperlinked HTML
files.<br>
    </p>
       
<blockquote><i>(This doesn't include classes in the libraries for J2EE  and
 J2ME.)</i><br>
    </blockquote>
       
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Major capabilities reside in the class libraries</b></font><br>
      </p>
           
<p>Once you understand how OOP is implemented in Java <i>(see my <a
 href="http://www.dickbaldwin.com/tocint.htm">Essence of OOP</a>  series
of tutorial lessons)</i> and you get beyond <b>while</b> loops, <b>if</b>
statements, and other fundamental programming concepts, virtually all the
power of  Java resides in:<br>
      </p>
           
<ul>
        <li>Classes and methods in the class library that you use directly.</li>
        <li>Classes and methods in the class library that you extend.</li>
        <li>New classes and methods that you define.</li>
           
</ul>
           
<p></p>
           
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Download versus online versions</b></font><br>
      </p>
           
<p>If you have the available required space on your disk, I strongly recommend
   that you <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html#docs">download
  </a>the documentation and install it locally on your disk.&nbsp; This 
will   make it possible for you access it more rapidly than accessing it
on line,   which may make you more inclined to use it.<br>
      </p>
           
<p>However, to be more general, most of the references to the documentation
   in this tutorial will refer to the online version.&nbsp; That will make
 this material available to all readers without presupposing that it has
been  downloaded and  installed locally.<br>
      </p>
           
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Top-level online documentation</b></font><br>
    </p>
       
<p>As of the date of this writing, you can view the top-level page of the
   documentation for J2SE 1.4.1 at <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/index.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/index.html</a>.
 &nbsp; <i>(Once again, as Sun releases new versions of the SDK, they will
 establish new URLs for those new versions, and many of the links in this
document may become broken.)</i><br>
      </p>
           
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Subdivided into categories</b></font><br>
  </p>
   
<p>When you view the top-level page, you will find a link bar at the top
of the page that  subdivides the documentation into the following categories:<br>
      </p>
           
<ul>
        <li>Search</li>
        <li>General Info</li>
        <li>API &amp; Language</li>
        <li>Guide to Features</li>
        <li>Tool Docs</li>
        <li>Demos/Tutorials </li>
           
</ul>
           
<p></p>
           
<p>Of these categories, you will probably most frequently make use of the
  <i>API  &amp; Language</i> category.&nbsp; However, you should not ignore
  the other categories.&nbsp; They will often contain information that you
 need, and they can make you  more efficient in using the API documentation.<br>
      </p>
           
<p>As you will see as you read through this lesson, there is other information
   in the documentation that doesn't fall in one of the categories listed
above.&nbsp; For example, if you have viewed the <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/index.html">online</a> version
 of the top-level page, you will have seen that there is a section entitled
 <i>"J2SE Platform at a Glance"</i>   at the top of the page that provides
 a visual indication of how the   Standard Edition is put together.<br>
      </p>
           
<p><b><font color="#ff0000">Search</font></b></p>
           
<p>If you follow the Search link at the top of the page, <i>(which is a two-step
 process)</i>, you   will arrive at a <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/search.html">search   engine page</a>
 that gives you the ability to do a keyword search on the  online documentation.&nbsp;
 <i>(The context here is a search keyword and  not a Java keyword, such as
 <b>while</b>.)</i>&nbsp; The search capability  is fairly typical allowing
  you to search documents: <br>
      </p>
           
<ul>
        <li>With all the words that you provide</li>
        <li>With an exact phrase&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        <li>With any of the words that you provide </li>
        <li>Without the words that you provide </li>
           
</ul>
           
<p>Very often, if you know how to describe what you are looking for, this
   search engine will provide you with a link to the documentation page that
  you need to view.<br>
      </p>
           
<p>However, as is often the case with search engines, unless you are able
 to narrow   your search appropriately, you are likely to get lots of hits
 that must be  investigated.<br>
      </p>
           
<p>Of particular interest to many of us is the capability to search for code
   samples from Sun that contain the keywords of interest.<br>
      </p>
           
<p><b><font color="#ff0000">New to Java Platform?</font></b><br>
      </p>
           
<p>One of the categories in the online version that doesn't appear in the
 above list is a category   for persons who are new to the Java programming
 environment.&nbsp; This category is entitled <i>"New   to Java Platform?"
 &nbsp;</i>When you follow that link, you will open an  online section of
the documentation that Sun describes in the following way:<i><br>
      </i></p>
           
<blockquote><i>"What do you need to get started? Which Java technology should
   you use? This collection of links to articles, tutorials, online books,
 and  software downloads helps you find what you need to start writing applications.</i><i>"</i><br>
      </blockquote>
           
<p>Needless to say, information of this sort can be extremely useful to persons
   who are just getting started with Java.<br>
      </p>
           
<p><b><font color="#ff0000">General Information</font></b></p>
           
<p>The <i>General Information</i> section of the documentation is subdivided
 into   the following categories:</p>
           
<ul>
        <li>Readme, Overview, Changes</li>
                       
  <ul>
          <li>README</li>
          <li>Enhancements and Changes in J2SE 1.4.1</li>
          <li>Release Notes</li>
          <li>New Features since J2SE 1.3</li>
          <li>Documentation Changes<br>
          </li>
                       
  </ul>
        <li>Installation Instructions</li>

          <li>Installation Notes for Solaris</li>
          <li>Installation Notes for Microsoft Windows</li>
          <li>Installation Notes for Linux<br>
          </li>
                       
  </ul>
        <li>Compatibility with previous versions</li>
        <li>Bugs</li>
        <li>Contacts</li>
        <li>Releases and Downloads</li>

  </ul>
        <li>Legal Notices&nbsp; </li>
           
</ul>
           
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Downloading and installing Java</b></font><br>
      </p>
           
<p>Of particular interest to most newcomers should be the <i>Download </i>section
   and the <i>Installation </i>section.<br>
      </p>
           
<p>As an aside, if you are running Java under Windows and are having difficulty
  compiling  and executing     Java applications, your problem may   have
to  do with the <i>CLASSPATH </i>environment variable.&nbsp; For example,
see    the discussion at the following URL:        </p>
           
<p><a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/tooldocs/windows/classpath.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/tooldocs/windows/classpath.html</a>
       </p>
                         
<p>Pay particular attention to discussions involving the <i>current     directory</i>
 at that URL.</p>
                         
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>API &amp; Language</b></font><br>
      </p>
           
<p>This section is subdivided into the following categories:</p>
           
<p></p>
           
<ul>
        <li>Java 2 Platform API Specification</li>
        <li>Note About sun.* Packages</li>
        <li>The Java Language Specification</li>
        <li>The Java Virtual Machine Specification</li>
           
</ul>
           
<p>The first item in the above list is a link to the <i>API Specification.
  </i>&nbsp;This is probably  the most frequently used section of the entire
  documentation package.&nbsp; I  am going to put that discussion on hold
for right now and come back to it later.<br>
      </p>
           
<p>The second item in the above list contains some cautions for developers
   who may be inclined to use certain packages that may not exist in the
future.<br>
      </p>
           
<p>You can view or download the specifications for the core language and
the virtual machine using the third and fourth items in this section.<br>
      </p>
           
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Guide to Features - Java Platform</b></font><br>
      </p>
           
<p>This section typically contains a summary of new features in the current
   release, plus a long list of links to many of the older features supported
  by Java.<br>
      </p>
           
<p>For example, if you happen to be interested in data collections, you should
   click on the <i>Collections Framework</i> link.&nbsp; That will take you
  to a page  that describes <i>The Collections Framework,</i> including such
  items as:<br>
      </p>
           
<ul>
        <li>An overview of the <i>Collections framework.</i></li>
        <li>An annotated outline of the classes and interfaces comprising 
the   collections framework, with links into the JavaDoc.</li>
        <li>A tutorial introduction to the collections framework with programming
  examples.</li>
        <li>An annotated list of API changes between the 1.3 and 1.4 releases.</li>
        <li>An annotated list of previous API changes in the 1.3 release.</li>
        <li>Answers to frequently asked questions concerning the design of
 the   collections framework. </li>
           
</ul>
           
<p>Information of this sort can be extremely useful when you are just beginning
 to use a particular feature supported by Java.<br>
      </p>
           
<p><b><font color="#ff0000">Tool Docs</font></b></p>
           
<p>This section provides detailed information on Java tools such as:<br>
      </p>
           
<ul>
        <li>The java compiler,&nbsp;javac </li>
        <li>The java virtual machine, java</li>
        <li>The java documentation generator,&nbsp;javadoc</li>
        <li>The Java RMI Compiler, rmic</li>
        <li>The Java Remote Object Registry, rmiregistry.&nbsp; </li>
           
</ul>
           
<p>For example, this would be a good place to look if you need to learn more
   about the relationship between the java compiler (javac) and the CLASSPATH
   environment variable.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
           
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Demos, Tutorials, Training, and Reference</b></font><br>
      </p>
           
<p>As the name suggests, this section contains links to numerous documents
   that can help you learn how to become a Java programmer.&nbsp; This is
 in addition to the tutorials that you will find in the <i>Guide to Features</i>
  described above.&nbsp; Some of the items in this section are available
free   of charge, and others must be purchased.<br>
      </p>
           
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Now back to the Java 2 Platform API Specification</b></font></p>
           
<p>Earlier in the discussion under <i>API &amp; Language,</i> I mentioned
  that the  link to the <i>API Specification</i> is probably the most frequently
  used section of the entire documentation package.&nbsp; I promised in that
  discussion  that I would come back to the API Specification later.<br>
  </p>
   
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Shortcuts on the desktop</b></font><br>
      </p>
           
<p>As a practical matter, I keep two documentation shortcuts on my desktop.&nbsp; 
One shortcut links to the top-level documentation installed on my machine.&nbsp; 
The second shortcut links to the <i>API Specification</i> section of the documentation
 installed on my machine<i> (you could do the same thing with the online
version if you don't have  room to install the documentation package locally).</i>&nbsp;
Having these shortcuts on my desktop makes it quick and easy for me to access
 the documentation whenever I need to look something up, <i>(which is a very
 frequent occurrence).</i><br>
    </p>
         
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>A screen shot</b></font><br>
     </p>
         
<p>Figure 1 shows a partial screen shot of what you see when you first load 
  the API Specification into your browser.&nbsp; <i>(This screen shot was
 adjusted and cropped  to make it fit into this narrow publication format.)</i><br>
      </p>
           
<p align="center"><img src="java002a.jpg" alt="Java Docs Screen Shot"
 width="394" height="460">
     <br>
      </p>
         
<div align="center"> </div>
         
<p align="center">Figure 1 API specification screen shot<br>
     </p>
         
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>API specification screen layout</b></font><br>
    </p>
       
<p>The purpose of providing this partial screen shot is to give you an idea
 of the general layout of the material as it appears on your screen.&nbsp; 
As you can see, the layout consists of three frames when viewed in your HTML
 browser.&nbsp; <i>(A version without frames is also available.)</i><br>
     </p>
         
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>The left-hand frames</b></font><br>
    </p>
       
<p>The upper left-hand frame contains a list of packages.&nbsp; The lower 
  left-hand frame contains a list of the classes and interfaces that are contained
  in the package that is selected in the top left-hand frame.&nbsp; You make
 selections in these two frames <i>(or in the link bar at the top of the
page)</i> to control the contents of the right-hand frame.<br>
    </p>
       
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>The right-hand frame</b></font><br>
    </p>
         
<p>When you first access the documentation <i>(and when you select <b>Overview
  </b>at the top of the page),</i> the right-hand frame contains summary
information   about all of the packages.<br>
    </p>
       
<p>When you select a class in the lower left-hand frame, the right-hand frame
  contains hyperlinked information about that class, including:</p>
         
<ul>
       <li>A visual class hierarchy diagram</li>
       <li>Interfaces implemented by the class</li>
       <li>Known subclasses of the class</li>
       <li>Text description of the class</li>
       <li>Summary of nested classes</li>
       <li>Summary of fields defined in the class</li>
       <li>Summary of fields inherited into the class</li>
       <li>Summary and detailed information on constructors defined in the
 class</li>
       <li>Summary and detailed information on methods defined in the class</li>
       <li>List of methods inherited into the class<br>
       </li>
         
</ul>
         
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>The link bar at the top of the page</b></font><br>
    </p>
       
<p>Despite the use of hyperlinks, it can still sometimes be difficult to
find what you are looking for in the documentation package.&nbsp; Referring
back to Figure 1, you can see the beginning of a link bar at the top of the
page in the right-hand frame.&nbsp; This link bar contains the following
hyperlinks:<br>
     </p>
         
<ul>
       <li>Overview - provides summary information about packages <i>(shown 
 in Figure 1).</i></li>
       <li>Package - provides a description of the package selected in the
 upper-left  and lower-left frames.</li>
       <li>Class - provides a description of the class selected in the lower-left 
  frame.</li>
       <li>Use - describes how the class selected in the lower-left frame 
is  used in various packages.</li>
       <li>Tree - provides detailed inheritance hierarchy information for 
a  selected  package.</li>
       <li>Deprecated - provides a list of material that has been deprecated
      <i>(may not be supported in future versions)</i></li>
       <li>Index - provides a hyperlinked alphabetized index of interfaces, 
 classes,  constructors, variables, and methods.</li>
       <li>Help - Describes how the API document is organized. </li>
         
</ul>
         
<p>The various pages that are displayed by selecting these hyperlinks can 
  often help you to find what you are looking for.&nbsp; Probably the most 
 useful and frequently consulted item in the above list is the <i>Index.</i><br>
     </p>
         
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>The alphabetical index</b></font><br>
     </p>
           
<p>The alphabetical index can be extremely useful if you know the full or 
  partial spelling of what you are looking for, beginning with the first character.<br>
     </p>
         
<p>For example, assume that you remember <i>(or you can surmise from what 
  you know about Java properties)</i> that there is a method whose name begins 
  with <b>getSystemLookAndFeel</b>, which returns the name of the <i>LookAndFeel</i> 
  class that implements the native look and feel for a particular operating 
  system.&nbsp; You can easily look this up under G in the alphabetical index.<br>
     </p>
         
<p>What you will find when you look it up is a brief description of a method 
  named <b>getSystemLookAndFeelClassName</b>, which matches what you are looking
  for.&nbsp; The name of the method is also a hyperlink to the detailed description
  of the same method as it appears in the documentation for the class named
  <b>UIManager</b>.<br>
     </p>
         
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>A weakness in the documentation</b></font><br>
     </p>
         
<p>Unfortunately, there is a major weakness in the search capabilities of 
  the documentation package.&nbsp; If you don't know the spelling, beginning 
  with the first character, there is no good way to search the documentation
  without using outside resources.<br>
    </p>
       
<p>For example, assume that you remember <i>(or you can surmise from what
  you know about Java properties)</i> that there is a method whose name includes
  the characters <b>SystemLookAndFeel</b>, which returns the name of the
<i>LookAndFeel</i>   class that implements the native look and feel for a
particular operating   system.&nbsp; You cannot easily look up the name of
the method in the alphabetical   index, because you don't know the first
character in the method name.<br>
  </p>
   
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>HTML files are text files</b></font><br>
    </p>
       
<p>The documentation consists of a large number of HTML files.&nbsp; Because
  these are simply text files, you can attempt to locate what you need by
applying  a text search program to those HTML files after you install the
documentation on your system.<br>
     </p>
         
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Using a GREP program</b></font><br>
     </p>
         
<p>If you are unfamiliar with GREP programs, go to <a
 href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a> and search for
GREP.&nbsp; You should find several downloadable GREP programs, an interesting
one of which is located at <a href="http://www.wingrep.com/">http://www.wingrep.com/</a>.<br>
    </p>
       
<p>If you have downloaded and installed Sun's Java documentation on your
system, you can use a GREP program to search for keywords in the HTML files
that constitute the documentation package.<br>
    </p>
       
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>A GREP search example</b></font><br>
    </p>
       
<p>For example, by using a typical GREP program to search for the keyword
  <b>SystemLookAndFeel</b> in the <b>j2sdk1.4.1_02\docs\API\index-files</b> 
  folder on my hard drive, I was able to quickly determine that the documentation
  file named <b>index-7.html</b> contains a hyperlink to <i>"../javax/swing/UIManager.html#<b>getSystemLookAndFeelClassName()</b>".</i> 
&nbsp; That is all that I needed to know to go the <b>UIManager </b>class
  and look up the method named <b>getSystemLookAndFeelClassName</b>.<br>
     </p>
         
<p>If I didn't know to search for <b>SystemLookAndFeel</b>, but instead searched
  simply for <b>LookAndFeel</b>, I would get a fairly large number of hits
 from the  GREP program, but it would still be practical to examine them
in  an attempt to  recognize the name of the method that I was looking for.<br>
    </p>
       
<p>In that case, I probably would have noticed rather quickly that there
are a large number of links to the page that describes the <b>UIManager</b>
 class.&nbsp; I probably would have gone to the documentation for the <b>UIManager
  </b>class to manually examine the methods in that class before examining
 all of the hits produced by the GREP program.</p>
       
<h2 align="center"><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h2>
                 
<p>There are several ways to search for useful information in the Sun  documentation.&nbsp;
 There is no single approach that will solve all of your  needs to find information
 in the documentation. You simply need to become  familiar with the different
 ways to search for information in the documentation  and be prepared to
use  the approach that does the best job in each situation.<br>
