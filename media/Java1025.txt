The factory methods of the BorderFactory class 
can be used to produce Border objects that are 
shared, and therefore can be more 
memory-efficient than their counterparts 
instantiated using the new operator.

You can specify the highlight and shadow colors 
for various Border objects.  However, you need to 
be careful when you do.  Otherwise, you may spoil 
the 3D optical illusion for many observers.
