Every component that extends JComponent has the following three 
properties:

    preferredSize
    minimumSize
    maximumSize

Different layout managers behave differently with respect to 
these three properties.

This lesson shows you how to control the values of these 
three properties.  It also shows you how a BoxLayout 
behaves with respect to these properties when the physical size of 
the container is changed.
