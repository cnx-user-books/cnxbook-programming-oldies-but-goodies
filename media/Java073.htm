Students in Prof. Baldwin's <b><u>Intermediate Java Programming</u></b>
classes at ACC are responsible for knowing and understanding all of the
material in this lesson.

This lesson provides a <u>very brief</u> preview of some of what you can
expect to find in subsequent lessons regarding the Abstract Windows Toolkit
(<b>AWT</b>) and the <b>Swing</b> component set.

<p>The user interface of a modern computer program often involves techniques
to activate many of the human senses. We use <i>icons, text boxes, images,
sound, boardroom graphics, etc.</i>

<p>Up to this point, we haven't been too concerned with these aspects of
programming because there was a lot that you needed to learn to prepare
yourself for understanding material of this sort.&nbsp; That is about to
change.

<p>Much of the actual programming that you will do with Java will involve
those aspects of the interface that we commonly refer to as the <b>Graphical
User Interface (GUI)</b>.&nbsp;

<p>As of 5/10/98, there are two primary packages that are used for <b>GUI</b>
programming under JDK 1.1.6:
<ol><li>
java.<b>awt</b>.*</li>

<li>
com.sun.java.<b>swing</b>.*</li></ol>
There are, of course, numerous other packages that are used in support
of these two.

<p>The <b>AWT</b> material was made available to Java programmers early
in the life of Java.&nbsp; This was the original material that was used
to create graphical user interfaces.&nbsp; Major improvements to the <b>AWT</b>
were introduced with the release of JDK 1.1.

<p>The <b>Swing</b> components became available in released form for use
with JDK 1.1 around the beginning of 1998.&nbsp; These components added
significantly to the ability of the programmer to create GUIs, both in
terms of functionality and cosmetics.

<p>The capability and cosmetics of the AWT were very limited but <b>Swing</b>
made GUI programming in Java competitive in the real world.&nbsp; A Java
programmer no longer need apologize for the quality of the GUIs that she
can create.

<p>We expect that these two packages may become more integrated (causing
changes in your <b>import</b> statements) with the release of JDK 1.2,
(probably sometime in 1998) but hopefully the concepts involved won't be
greatly different.

<p>As of 3/5/97, there were more than fifty classes defined in package
<b>java.awt</b>. We will discuss some of the more important <b>AWT</b>
classes in subsequent lessons.

<p>As of 5/10/98, the <i>com.sun.java.swing</i> package contains more than
75 classes and about 20 interfaces.&nbsp; You might expect, therefore,
that learning to use this material effectively won't be a trivial task.

<p>It is very important to understand that <b>Swing</b> is an extension
of, and <u>not a replacement for</u> the AWT.&nbsp; While it is true that
there is some overlap (for example a <b>Swing JButton</b> component might
be viewed as an improved functional replacement for an <b>AWT Button</b>
component, and once you begin using <b>Swing</b> buttons you may choose
to never again use an <b>AWT</b> button), the basic functionality of <b>Swing</b>
is built upon the functionality of the <b>AWT</b>.

<p>Therefore, as students, we cannot simply skip over an understanding
of the <b>AWT</b> and move on to <b>Swing</b>.&nbsp; The <b>AWT</b> is
the <u>foundation</u> for <b>Swing</b>.

<p>We must first understand the <b>AWT</b> and then understand how <b>Swing</b>
extends and improves on the <b>AWT</b>.&nbsp; I will attempt to integrate
an understanding of both the <b>AWT</b> and <b>Swing</b> in the remaining
lessons in these Java tutorials.

<p>We will begin by introducing you to a few simple components of each
type and use these components to teach you about such topics as event-driven
programming, layout, graphics, etc.&nbsp; Then, time permitting, we will
dig a little deeper into the more complex aspects of both the <b>AWT</b>
and <b>Swing </b>components and other features.

<p>What I won't do is show you a lot of pictures of various <b>AWT</b>
and <b>Swing</b> components as is the case with many books and other tutorials
(although such pictures can be important for an appreciation of GUI programming.).&nbsp;
(Have you noticed how many Java books use copies of the JavaSoft documentation
as filler material to make the book appear to contain more information
than it actually contains?&nbsp; At least half of many of the books currently
in print is nothing more than a reproduction of the documentation that
you can download for free from JavaSoft. Oh well, enough of that!)

<p>If you want to see some pictures of <b>AWT</b> and <b>Swing</b> components
(which would be only natural), you can create them yourself on your own
computer screen.

<p>For examples of the <b>AWT</b> components, simply look in the folders
in the software that you downloaded from JavaSoft.&nbsp; When you install
JDK 1.1.6, a folder named "demo" will be created that contains about two-dozen
sample programs.&nbsp; Many of these sample programs have graphical user
interfaces that make use of the <b>AWT</b>.&nbsp; Just run the programs
to see examples of the use of the <b>AWT</b>.

<p>When you download and install <b>Swing</b> 1.0.1, a folder named "examples"
will be created.&nbsp; This folder contains about nine folders, each of
which contains a demonstration application or applet that makes use of
<b>Swing</b>.&nbsp; You can run these programs to see the examples on your
computer screen.

<p>A particularly interesting demonstration application is the one named
<b>SwingSet</b>.&nbsp; One of the new components in <b>Swing</b> is a tabbed
pane that looks much like a common cardboard file folder with a labeled
tab on the top, bottom, left, or right.&nbsp; The <b>AWT</b> doesn't contain
such a component.

<p>This demonstration starts with about twenty such tabbed panes on the
screen, each one of which demonstrates one aspect of the use of <b>Swing</b>.&nbsp;
By clicking on each of the labeled tabs, you can select and exercise one
aspect of <b>Swing</b>.&nbsp; In addition, there are five menus that contain
selections, some of which impact the behavior of some aspect of the demonstration.

<p>While you are there, pay attention to the fact that virtually all of
the <b>Swing</b> components are also containers, so it is possible to cause
other items (such as images) to be contained in components such as buttons
and menus.

<p>Take a look at the pane labeled <i>RadioButtons</i> and see how two
different images of JavaSoft's little creature named Duke can be made to
function as a radio button. In this case, the selected Duke is waving while
the unselected Dukes aren't waving.

<p>Duke shows up again under <i>ToggleButtons</i> where the button which
has been toggled has Duke animated in a child's <b>swing</b>.

<p>The <i>Checkboxes</i> pane uses light bulbs that either are or are not
illuminated to illustrate selection of <b>Checkbox</b> items.

<p>The examples on the <i>Slider</i> pane are truly impressive (the <b>AWT</b>
doesn't have a slider component, although it is possible to use a <b>ScrollBar</b>
as a crude slider).

<p>Take a look at the <i>ListBox</i> pane to see another example of using
images inside of a component.

<p>The <i>DebugGraphics</i> pane demonstrates how to run your program in
slow motion so that you can see how the components are assembled for debugging
purposes. Note that a <b>Slider</b> is used to control the speed of assembly
of the components.

<p>And of course, every where you turn in this demo, you will see <i>tool
tips</i> that are not a part of the <b>AWT</b>.&nbsp; For a little comic
relief, take a look at the <i>ToolTips</i> pane.

<p>Don't forget to pull down the <i>Options</i> menu and select the "look
and feel" of the different panes as you view them.

<p>Actually, words are inadequate to describe what you are going to find
when you install and run the <b>SwingSet</b> demonstration.&nbsp; To use
a corny phrase made famous by an old TV commercial (which many of you are
probably too young to remember), "Try it, you'll like it."
