<h3> <a name="What_is_Greenfoot">What is Greenfoot?</a></h3>
<p> Greenfoot is a combination of a Java IDE that provides a class browser, 
compilation, interactive execution, single-step execution, a code editor, etc., 
on one hand and a framework for creating two-dimensional animations, games, and 
simulations on the other hand <i>(see Greenfoot Home in <a href="#Resources">Resources</a>)</i>.&nbsp; 
Greenfoot is also available free of charge.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Relatively painless, fun, and engaging</b></font></p>
<p>Greenfoot provides a painless, fun, and engaging entry point for 
novice programmers but also supports the full power of the Java programming 
language for more advanced programmers.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Fun and engaging</b></font></p>
<p>Greenfoot is fun and engaging because Greenfoot makes it relatively easy for 
novice programmers to create 2D games, animations, and simulations.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Powerful</b></font></p>
<p>Greenfoot is powerful because it allows for the use of the same Java code 
that an advanced Java programmer would use in a major Java project.&nbsp; Included in that power is the ability to do any or all of the 
following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Execute the scenario <i>(project)</i> inside the IDE, either in 
	single-step mode or run mode.</li>
	<li>Export the scenario as a Java applet in a JAR file with an accompanying 
	HTML file.</li>
	<li>Export the scenario as an application in an executable JAR file.</li>
	<li>Publish the scenario on the Greenfoot web site for review and comment by 
	others.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Terminology - scenario or project</b></font></p>
<p>As a matter of clarification, most of the Greenfoot documentation uses the 
word <i>scenario</i> to describe what might be referred to as a <i>project</i> 
in other programming environments and IDEs.&nbsp; For purposes of this tutorial, the two terms are 
interchangeable.</p>

<p>This is an animation scenario involving a stage and an actor.&nbsp; The blue rectangle on the left

Note, however, that there could be many actors in a more complicated scenario.)</i></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Classes and objects</b></font></p>
<p>This stage is the visual manifestation of an object created from the 
class 
named <b>MyWorld</b> shown in the class diagram on the right in Figure 1.&nbsp; 
The 
spider is the visual manifestation of an object created from the class named <b>MyActor</b> shown in the 
class diagram on the right.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>A quick explanation of classes and objects</b></font></p>
<p>I have much more to say about classes and objects in other lessons on my 
website <i>(see Dick Baldwin's Programming Tutorials in <a href="#Resources">
Resources</a>)</i>.&nbsp; For now, 
suffice it to say that a class is analogous to a set of blueprints or plans from 
which something can be constructed.&nbsp; An object is the thing that is 
constructed from those blueprints.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Overall behavior</b></font></p>
<p>A little later, I will show you the Java code that produces the behavior that 
I am about to describe.&nbsp; This scenario is designed to animate the spider and cause it to move diagonally 
down and to the right across the stage toward the lower right corner.</p>
<p>At the bottom of Figure 1, you see a button labeled <b>Act</b> and another button labeled <b>Run</b>.&nbsp; Each time the button labeled <b>Act</b> is clicked, the spider will move one 
step to the right and one step down.&nbsp; <i>(I will explain what I mean by one 
step <a href="#with_each_step">later</a>.)</i>&nbsp; If the button labeled <b>Run</b> is clicked, the spider 
will move in incremental steps toward the lower right corner.&nbsp; The effect 
of clicking the <b>Run</b> button is the same as if someone were to repeatedly click the <b>Act</b> button.&nbsp; When the spider 
reaches the lower right boundary of the stage, it will stop.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The Reset button and the speed slider</b></font></p>
<p>You can also see a button labeled <b>Reset</b> in Figure 1.&nbsp; This button 
does what most buttons labeled reset do.&nbsp; It resets the program.</p>
<p>There is also a 
speed slider on the bottom of the IDE but it doesn't show in Figure 1.&nbsp; This slider is used to 
increase or decrease the animation speed.&nbsp; <i>(The slider doesn't show in 
Figure 1 because I had to manually reduce the width of the IDE 
to make it fit into this narrow publication format.)</i> </p>
<h3><a name="The_classes_named_World_and_Actor">The classes named World and Actor</a></h3>
<p>The classes named <b>World</b> and <b>Actor</b> are part of the Greenfoot IDE and are always there when you 
create a new scenario.&nbsp; 
Their purpose is to make it easy to write animation, game, and simulation 
scenarios in addition to more general-purpose Java programs.&nbsp; A custom API 
is also included with the IDE to support that purpose.</p>
<p>To define the class named <b>MyWorld</b> so that I could construct an object 
from that class to represent the stage, I extended <i>(or inherited from)</i> the 
class named <b>World</b>.&nbsp; 
The arrow that points from <b>MyWorld</b> up to <b>
World</b> in the class diagram on the right side of Figure 1 indicates that <b>
MyWorld</b> extends <b>World</b>.&nbsp; Similarly, to define the 
class named <b>MyActor</b> 
so that I could construct an object from that class, I extended the class named <b>Actor</b>.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>What does it mean to extend or inherit from another 
class?</b></font></p>
<p>For the benefit of beginners, let's consider a hypothetical analogy.&nbsp; <i>
(Experienced Java programmers can skip this section.)</i>&nbsp; Assume that you go to an 
architect to purchase a set of plans to build a new house.&nbsp; Assume also that the 
architect has in her files, a general set of plans named <b>World</b> that 
describes features of all the houses in the development where your house is 
going to be built.&nbsp; She makes a copy of those plans and that copy becomes a 
part of the plans for your new house.</p>
<p>Assume that she draws additional plans that refer to everything in the
<b>World</b> plans and supplements that information with information that is 
peculiar to your house, such as the types of appliances, the types of bathroom 
fixtures, the floor coverings, etc.&nbsp; She names the second set of plans <b>
MyWorld</b>, and they also become part of the plans for your new house.&nbsp; In 
effect, the second set of plans has extended the original set of plans and the 
overall plans for your house include both <b>World</b> and <b>MyWorld</b>.</p>
<p>The architect delivers the two sets of plans to you and you deliver them to the 
construction contractor who uses them to build your new house.&nbsp; Your new 
house will have characteristics that are common to all of the houses in the 
development and will also have characteristics that are peculiar to your 
individual house.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>A fairly good analogy</b></font></p>
<p>This is a fairly good analogy to the concept of classes, inheritance, and objects in 
Java.&nbsp; The two sets of construction plans are analogous to the two classes 
shown by the two upper boxes in the class diagram in Figure 1.&nbsp; The completed house 
is analogous to an object that is constructed from those two classes <i>(the 
stage in this case)</i>.&nbsp; The Java code constructs an object from the plans <i>(class)</i> 
named <b>MyWorld</b>, and the characteristics defined the plans <i>(class)</i> 
named <b>World</b> are included in the object through inheritance.</p>
<p>The Java code that constructs the object is analogous to the construction 
contractor that constructs your new house.</p>
<p>You could also say that the two sets of construction plans are analogous to 
the two classes shown by the two boxes in the lower right in Figure 1, and that 
the completed house is analogous to the object that is constructed from those 
two classes <i>(represented by the spider image)</i>.</p>

<p>You don't need to worry too much about the details of the code shown in

	</tr>
</table>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The class named MyWorld extends World</b></font></p>
<p>Note first the code shown in blue in Listing 1.&nbsp; 
This code stipulates that the new class named <b>MyWorld</b> extends <i>
(inherits from)</i> the class named <b>World</b>.&nbsp; That satisfies the 
inheritance relationship shown by the top two classes in Figure 1.</p>

</table>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The constructor</b></font></p>
<p>The code shown in red is called a constructor.&nbsp; This code is analogous 
to the construction contractor that built your new house in the earlier discussion.&nbsp; 
The purpose of this code is to cause the object to come into existence and to occupy 
memory.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The stage</b></font></p>
<p>You can write general-purpose Java programs using Greenfoot that pretty much ignore 
most of what you see in Figure 1.&nbsp; However, if you want to use Greenfoot 
to create a 2D animation, game, or simulation, the easiest thing to do is to take advantage 
of the structure for the stage and the actors that already exist in the IDE.</p>
<p>

	just set the super parameters to (1,1,1).</td></tr></table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The stage in a Greenfoot scenario is always a rectangular grid of square cells.&nbsp; 
The statement in Listing 1 that begins with the word <b>super</b> specifies that the 
dimensions of the stage for this scenario are 20 cells by 20 cells.&nbsp; The first number is the 
width of the stage in cells and the second number is the height of the stage in 
cells.&nbsp; The third number specifies that each cell is a square that is ten 
pixels on each side.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The spider jerks along</b></font></p>
<p>If you write and run this scenario, you will see that the spider moves 
along rather jerkily, <a name="with_each_step">with each step</a> taken by the 
spider being from the center of the current cell 
to the center of the next cell along the diagonal path.&nbsp; We could make the 
spider move much more smoothly by increasing the number of cells and making each 
cell smaller.&nbsp; However, this would also cause the spider to appear to move 
more slowly because it would have to take more steps to move the same physical 
distance on the stage.</p>

<b>Class definition code for the class named MyActor</b></font></p>

  </tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Color added</b></font></p>
<p>Once again, I added color to make the code easier to discuss.&nbsp; Beginning 
with the code shown in blue, the class named <b>MyActor</b> extends the 
class 
named <b>Actor</b> satisfying the inheritance relationship given by the 
two corresponding classes shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The method named <i>act</i></b></font></p>
<p>The code shown in red is the definition of a method named <b>act</b>.&nbsp; 
This method is executed once each time the <b>Act</b> button at the bottom of 
Figure 1 is clicked.&nbsp; Also, as mentioned earlier, his method is executed repeatedly when the <b>Run</b> 
button in Figure 1 is clicked.</p>
<p>The purpose of this method is to cause the spider to 
move diagonally across the stage, moving down and to the right.&nbsp; The stage 
is represented by a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin at the upper 
left corner.&nbsp; The x-axis is the horizontal axis and the y axis is the 
vertical axis.&nbsp; The positive x-direction is to the right.&nbsp; Contrary to 
what you might expect, the positive y-direction is down the screen instead of 
up.</p>
<p>Each 
cell width constitutes one unit on the respective axes with the cell in the upper-left 
corner having a coordinate value of 0,0.&nbsp; There are 20 cells across and 20 
cells down.&nbsp; Therefore, the coordinate value of the cell at the upper-right 
corner is 19,0.&nbsp; The coordinate value of the cell at the bottom left corner 
is 0,19, and the coordinate value of the cell at the bottom right corner is 
19,19.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Make the spider move</b></font></p>
<p>The code in the <b>act</b> method in Listing 2 causes the spider to move one 
cell to the right and one cell down each time the method is executed.&nbsp; This 
is accomplished by calling the <b>setLocation</b> method to cause the spider's 
new location to be one cell to the right and one cell down from the current 
cell.&nbsp; This, in turn is accomplished by getting the x and y coordinate 
values of the current cell, adding one to each of those values, and using those 
two sums to define the new location.</p>
<h3><a name="Convenience_features">Convenience features</a></h3>
<p>This IDE provides several convenience features that make it easy for novice 
programmers to get something interesting up and running quickly without having 
to know a lot about Java programming.&nbsp; As mentioned 
earlier, it is also possible for more advanced Java programmers to use the IDE to write Java applications or 
applets that exercise the full power of Java, completely ignoring most of the 
convenience features of the IDE if they choose to do so.&nbsp; Thus, Greenfoot 
provides a little something for everybody.&nbsp; In this 
lesson, I will concentrate on the use of the convenience features.</p>

The stripes mean that the class needs to be compiled before it can be used.&nbsp; You

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Putting some meat on the skeleton</b></font></p>
<p>Skeleton code for a new class is automatically created whenever you create a new class using the <b>
New subclass</b> option shown in Figure 4.&nbsp; The first time you select the 
<b>Open editor</b> option in the context menu for the new class, the skeleton 
code will appear in the editor.&nbsp; The image shown in Figure 5 was captured 
after I modified the skeleton code to produce the source code shown in Listing 
1.</p>
<p>The editor is a fairly standard source-code editor with a few features 
designed specifically for use with Greenfoot.&nbsp; I'm not going to bore you 
with all 
of the operational details of the editor because I doubt that you need those 
details.&nbsp; You can probably figure out most of what you need to know on 
your own with a little experimentation.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Source code versus documentation</b></font></p>
<p>There is one aspect of the editor that is different from the norm and worth 
mentioning.&nbsp; Whenever you create a scenario in Greenfoot, standard Java documentation is 
automatically generated for all of the classes in the scenario.&nbsp; I explain 
the format of that documentation a separate document titled <i>
The Importance of Sun's Java Documentation (see <a href="#Resources">Resources</a>).</i></p>
<p>You will notice that there is a pull-down list in the upper right corner of 
Figure 5.&nbsp; That list contains the following two options:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Source Code</b></li>
	<li><b>Documentation</b></li>
</ul>
<p>When <i>Source Code</i> is selected, the window serves as a source code 
editor for the class.&nbsp; When <i>Documentation</i> is selected, the window 
serves as a non-editable display window for the standard documentation of the 
class being edited.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Compiling the source code</b></font></p>
<p>Any time you modify the source code for a class, you must compile the new 
source code before you can use the modified class.&nbsp; You can compile the 
modified source code in at least three ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Click the <b>Compile</b> button shown in Figure 5.</li>
	<li>Pull down the <b>Tools</b> menu in Figure 5 and select <b>Compile</b>.</li>
	<li>Click the <b>Compile all</b> button in Figure 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever a class needs to be compiled, it will appear with diagonal lines as 
shown by the <b>MyActor</b> class in Figure 2.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The <i>new MyWorld()</i> option</b></font></p>
<p>Getting back to the context menu in Figure 4, the <b>new MyWorld()</b> 
option is used to create a new object from the class named <b>MyWorld</b>.&nbsp; 
However, whenever you modify the code and then compile the class, a new object for the 
modified class is automatically created.&nbsp; Therefore, you probably won't 
need to use this option very often, if at all.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The <i>New subclass</i> option</b></font></p>
<p>There may be situations where you would want to define a new class that 
extends or inherits from the class named <b>MyWorld</b> in Figure 4.&nbsp; If 
so, you can do that by selecting <b>New subclass</b> in Figure 4, providing a 
name for the new class, selecting an image for the new class, etc.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The <i>Set image...</i> and <i>Remove</i> options</b></font></p>
<p>If you decide to change the image for the class after it has been created, 
the <b>Set image...</b> option can be used for that purpose.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the <b>Remove</b> option can be used to delete a class 
from the scenario if you decide that you don't need it after all.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>This should look familiar</b></font></p>
<p>By now, you should have a pretty good idea of the purpose of each of the 
options in the context menu.&nbsp; As is the case with the <b>World</b> class, you 
can open the <b>Actor</b> class and view the class definition in the editor.&nbsp; 
However, as I mentioned earlier, the <b>Actor</b> and <b>World</b> classes are read-only and 
cannot be modified.</p>
<p>I selected the <b>New subclass</b> option to create the class named <b>
MyActor</b> shown in Figure 1.&nbsp; When you select that option, the dialog shown 
in Figure 3 will appear.&nbsp; As with the <b>MyWorld</b> class discussed 
earlier, you use this dialog to specify a name for the new class and to select an 
image that will represent objects of the new class on the stage.&nbsp; If you 
don't select an image, the default image, which is a small green footprint, will 
be used.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The context menu for the MyActor class</b></font></p>
<p>If you right click on the <b>MyActor</b> class, a context menu similar to the 
one shown in Figure 4 will appear.&nbsp; The only difference will be that the 
first option will be titled <b>new MyActor()</b> instead of <b>new MyWorld()</b>.</p>
<p>The purpose of each option in this context menu is the same as the purpose of 
each corresponding option that 
I explained earlier in conjunction with the class named <b>MyWorld</b>.&nbsp; 
There is one major difference, however.&nbsp; Whereas you will rarely need to 
create new objects of the class named <b>MyWorld</b>, you may need 
to create objects of the <b>MyActor</b> class.&nbsp; Creating objects of the <b>
MyActor</b> class can be accomplished in at least three <a name="ways">ways</a>:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select the <b>new MyActor()</b> option from the context menu for the 
	class.</li>
	<li>Left-click the <b>MyActor</b> class once, hold down the Shift key and 
	left-click the location on the stage where you want the object to appear.</li>
	<li>Write standard Java code to create a new object of the class and add it 
	to your new world.&nbsp; <i>(One way to do this by calling the <b>addObject</b> 
	method in the constructor for your new world.)</i></li>
</ol>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Selecting the <i>new MyActor()</i> option from the

<p>The result of selecting the <b>new MyActor()</b> option is shown in Figure 7.&nbsp; 
However, Figure 7 doesn't show the mouse pointer, which is a critical part of 
the picture.&nbsp; <i>(Just pretend that you can see the mouse pointer pointing 
to the spider immediately to the left of the box for the class named <b>MyActor</b>.)</i></p>

<p>When you select
 <b>new MyActor()</b> from the context menu for the <b>MyActor</b> class, a new 
object of the class is created and the image that represents the object is 
attached to the mouse pointer.&nbsp; You can drag the image and drop it in the 
desired location on the stage.&nbsp; Initially the red circle with the diagonal 
line shown in Figure 7 will appear on top of the image indicating that you can't 
drop the object in that location.&nbsp; This symbol will 
disappear once you drag the image into the stage area, indicating that it is 
okay to drop the object anywhere in the stage area.</p>

there is no code in the program to cause them to do so.&nbsp; However, you can 
grab each spider with the mouse pointer and drag it to any location you choose

an explanation anyway so I won't provide one.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Only one method in the class definition</b></font></p>
<p>The context menu for an object shows all of the methods that are defined in the 
class from which the object was created.&nbsp; The class named <b>MyActor</b> 
defined only one method, and that is the method named <b>act</b> as shown in 
Listing 2.&nbsp; Therefore, the only method shown in the context menu in Figure 10 
is the method named <b>act</b>.</p>
<p>One interesting feature of the context menu is that you can click on a method 
name in the context menu and that method will be executed one time.&nbsp; This makes it 
possible to individually execute new methods that you write and compile so 
that you can confirm proper behavior of each method independently of the other 
methods in the class definition.&nbsp; However, this isn't too useful with the
<b>act</b> method because exactly the same thing happens each time you click the
<b>Act</b> button at the bottom of Figure 1.&nbsp; Therefore, this scenario

<p>Some of the information in Figure 12, such as the current location of the 
object in x and y 
coordinate values and the rotation of the object is intuitively obvious.&nbsp; Some is not so 
obvious.&nbsp; For example, if you double-click on the top box containing a 
crooked 
arrow, a second object inspector window will open containing information about 
the parent <i>(container)</i> object of the current object.&nbsp; In this case, 
the container is the object that was 
created from the class named <b>MyWorld</b>, which I have been referring to as 
the stage.</p>
<p>If you double-click on the bottom box containing a crooked arrow, another object 
inspector window will open containing information about the spider image that 
represents the object on the stage.&nbsp; That object inspector also contains 
some arrows, which can be double-clicked.&nbsp; The bottom line is that the <b>
Inspect</b> option on an object's context menu makes it possible for you obtain 
information about the object itself, and also to obtain information about other 
objects to which that object is linked.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Object linkages</b></font></p>
<p>The object created from the <b>
MyActor</b> class is linked to the object created from the <b>MyWorld</b> 
class 
because it is physically contained in that object on the stage.&nbsp; It is 
linked to an object that was originally created from a file containing an image 
of a spider because that 
image is being used to visually represent the object on the stage.&nbsp; That 
image object, by the way, was created from a class named <b>GreenfootImage</b>, 
which is one of the relatively hidden parts of the Greenfoot IDE that mainly 
does its work behind the scenes and out of sight.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The context menu for the stage</b></font></p>
<p>Right clicking the label <b>myWorld</b> at the top of Figure 1 causes a 
context menu 
to pop up for the object that was created from the class named <b>MyWorld</b>.&nbsp; 
There is nothing on that menu that I haven't already discussed, so there is no 
point in me discussing that context menu further.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Scenario Information</b></font></p>
<p>Clicking the button labeled <b>Scenario Information</b> at the top right of 
Figure 1 opens a text editor on a file named <b>README.TXT</b>.&nbsp; This file 
is contained in the folder that contains the scenario files.&nbsp; The text that is contained in the file 
when it opens encourages the developer to describe the scenario for the benefit 
of users who may later need that information.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="The_target_audience_">The target audience</a></h2>
<p>According to recent correspondence with 
<a href="#Historical_information_about_Greenfoot">Michael Kölling</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>&quot;Today, we are using Greenfoot with high school kids (age 14 and up), 
and at college and university level. I'd claim that as the target audience. We 
needed to get a bit of experience with actual classroom situations to see where 
the lower bound in the age group is, and 14 works well (as does anything older), 
and I wouldn't recommend it much below that age.&quot;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having taught computer programming at the community college level for about 
fifteen years and having taught Java OOP since 1997, I am of the opinion that 
the target audience for Greenfoot clearly includes students at the college 
level.</p>
<p>Also having taught Java OOP to many old-school procedural programmers who are still struggling with the transition from procedural to object-oriented 
programming, both at the college and in onsite company-sponsored training 
programs, I believe that the target audience also includes old-school procedural 
programmers.</p>
<h3><a name="Greenfoot_makes_learning_fun">Greenfoot makes learning fun</a></h3>
<p>My great granddaughter often repeats a saying that she learned in Montessori 
kindergarten, <i>&quot;Fun is learning and learning is fun.&quot;</i>&nbsp; Even at my 
somewhat advanced age, I couldn't agree more.</p>
<p>Greenfoot makes learning to program with Java not only practical but fun as 
well.&nbsp; Let's face it, regardless of our age, most of us do a better job on those 
tasks that we enjoy 
than we do on those tasks that we don't enjoy.&nbsp; So the question is, which 
activity would most 
students find more enjoyable?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Writing a Java program that causes an image of a 
spider to chase an image of a fly around the screen, or </li>
	<li>Writing a text-based Java program that computes and displays an 
	amortization table for a 30-year mortgage at an interest rate of 6.25 
	percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The same understanding of fundamentals is required</b></font></p>
<p>Both Java programs would require an understanding of the same fundamental 
programming concepts.&nbsp; The difference is that writing programs that provide 
sensory feedback <i>(such as spiders chasing flies)</i> can be fun while 
writing programs to compute amortization tables can be extremely boring.&nbsp; At 
least that is the case for most of the students that I have met during my fifteen years 
of teaching.</p>
<p>Thanks to Greenfoot, we as Java instructors now have the 
opportunity to conduct programming instruction that is not only solid from an 
educational and technical viewpoint, but is also fun and engaging for the students.&nbsp;
<i>(Even most old-school procedural programmers would probably rather spend time 
writing interesting OO programs than writing boring OO programs.)</i></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>This kind of help is needed</b></font></p>
<p>Without some help of the kind provided by Greenfoot, beginning programmers 
are not capable of writing a program that causes an image of a spider to chase 
an image of a fly around the screen, or much else in the way of interesting 
programs for that matter.&nbsp; <i>(Believe it or not, most students don't get 
too excited by if statements and while loops.)</i></p>
<p>Being able to start from scratch and 
write programs with exciting graphics requires knowledge of some fairly advanced 
Java programming concepts.&nbsp; Beginning programming students simply do not possess 
that knowledge and those students are usually relegated to writing 
boring programs of the <i>amortization-table</i> variety.&nbsp; </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The Xbox generation</b></font></p>
<p>Computer science enrollments are down in most high schools, colleges, and 
universities in the U.S.&nbsp; There are many reasons for this.&nbsp; In my 
opinion, one of the most important reasons is that most existing computer 
science curricula fail to satisfy the needs of the Xbox generation for something 
more stimulating than amortization tables.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The challenge</b></font></p>
<p>Computer programs of the amortization-table variety are clearly necessary in our economy.&nbsp; However, they 
should not be necessary in an introductory programming course in a high school, 
college, or university.&nbsp; Our challenge, as computer science instructors in the U.S., is to keep 
students involved, interested, and engaged long enough for them to realize that 
computer programming and computer science are interesting professions even if it 
may occasionally be necessary to write a program involving amortization tables 
or to satisfy other similarly boring objectives.</p>
<p>It has been shown in various studies at Carnegie Mellon University and 
elsewhere that making it possible for students to produce interesting results 
early in an introductory programming course tends to reduce the dropout rate.&nbsp; This should apply regardless of whether we 
are talking about high school students, community college students, 
computer-programming students in 
curricula other than hard-core computer science at the university level, first-year students with computer science aspirations at the 
university level, and even old-school procedural programmers struggling with the 
transition into OOP.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Boredom is a killer of ambition</b></font></p>
<p>With the advent of the web, there are many opportunities both inside and 
outside of hard-core computer science that require participants to understand 
and to be proficient in modern object-oriented programming using Java, C#, C++, 
or other similar programming languages.&nbsp; Boredom is a killer of ambition and 
the reality is that a large percentage of computer programming instruction in 
the U.S. is extremely boring for the first couple of semesters.&nbsp; Perhaps 
with products like Greenfoot, we can rectify that situation and rekindle 
interest in computer science among students in the U.S.</p>
<h3><a name="Speaking_of_the_web">Speaking of the web</a></h3>
<p>Once a Greenfoot scenario is completed and tested, Greenfoot makes it very
<a name="easy_to">easy to</a>:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Export the scenario as a stand-alone Java application suitable for 
	execution on just about any computer that has Java version 1.5 or later 
	installed <i>(without a requirement for the Greenfoot IDE to exist on that 
	computer)</i>.</li>
	<li>Export the scenario as an applet for publishing in a web page on your 
	favorite web server.</li>
	<li>Publish the scenario on a public Greenfoot website for execution and comments by others.</li>
</ol>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Writing dual-purpose programs is not easy</b></font></p>
<p>Writing a Java program so that it can be used either as an application or an 
applet isn't rocket science.&nbsp; However, writing such dual-purpose programs is well beyond the capabilities 
of most beginning programming students.&nbsp; However, Greenfoot makes it easy to do 
just that.</p>
<p>Many students maintain their own web sites and might like to show off their 
early programming creations by posting them as applets on their web sites.&nbsp; 
The ability to do this should be a positive 
motivating factor for many of those students.</p>
<p>Those same students, as well as many other students, might like to share their early 
programming creations with friends and family <i>(particularly those with slow 
or no Internet access)</i> as stand-alone Java applications.&nbsp; Greenfoot makes that 
easy also.&nbsp; The same Greenfoot program can be exported in both forms.</p>
<h3><a name="Greenfoot,_Scratch,_Alice,_and_BlueJ">Greenfoot, Scratch, Alice, 
and BlueJ</a></h3>
<p>While some tools are more advanced than others, there are currently at least four programming paradigms that occupy roughly

</ol>
<p>I am very familiar with the first three.&nbsp; I know 
very little about BlueJ so I won't comment on it at this time.&nbsp; <i>(There 
are probably others that I don't know about as well.)</i></p>

<h4><a name="Social_networking_for_nerds">Social networking for nerds</a></h4>
<p>The folks involved in the Scratch project at MIT have proven the positive 
effect of providing a capability for students to share their programming 
creations on a public website for review and comment by their peers.&nbsp; By 
providing this capability, they are attracting and keeping students engaged, 
involved, and learning about computer 
programming completely outside of formal schoolwork.&nbsp; <i>(This capability of Scratch is similar to item 3 in the above <a href="#easy_to">
list</a>.)</i></p>
<p>The Scratch website, on which students share programs written in Scratch, has become a form of social networking for 
thousands of young <i>scratchers</i> <i>(as they like to refer to themselves)</i> 
from around the world.&nbsp; I like to think of the Scratch website, in a 
positive sense, as social networking for nerds.&nbsp; <i>(By the way, I 
recognize that I am something of a nerd myself, so I don't consider nerd to be a 
derogatory term.)</i></p>
<h4><a name="Scratch_is_not_a_serious_programming_language">Scratch is not a 
serious programming language</a></h4>
<p>However, even though the Scratch website is incredibly popular among younger 
students, Scratch is not a serious programming language in the sense that Java, 
C++, and C# are serious programming languages.&nbsp; Scratch is seriously lacking insofar as 
support for important fundamental programming concepts is concerned.&nbsp;
<a name="Of_the_ten_to_fifteen">Of the ten to fifteen</a> fundamental 
programming concepts that most computer science professors agree to be extremely important, Scratch only supports three or four.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The main emphasis in Scratch is on multimedia capabilities</b></font></p>
<p>Once you get beyond <i>variables</i>, <i>if-else</i> statements, <i>loops</i>, and 
<i>operators</i> <i>
(which Scratch does support in a limited sense)</i>, Scratch is primarily a toy language 
that makes it easy for students to do wild and wonderful things with a wide 
array of multimedia capabilities.&nbsp; <i>(However, I believe that the multimedia capabilities are 
one of the factors that make Scratch so popular among younger students.)</i></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Developed in Squeak</b></font></p>
<p>Scratch was developed using a 
programming language named Squeak, but the underlying language is completely hidden from 
the Scratch programmer.&nbsp; Although I know nothing about Squeak, I don't 
believe that it is widely used in either academia or industry.&nbsp; Apparently, 
however, 
it was well suited for the development of Scratch.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Unconventional loop structures</b></font></p>
<p>While Scratch does support loop structures, the loop structures in Scratch 
are unconventional, at least from the viewpoint of someone whose primary 
programming experience for the past twenty years or so derives from a tradition 
rooted in C including C++, Java, and C#.&nbsp; I don't know if the unconventional loop structures in Scratch are a latent 
manifestation of Squeak and/or Smalltalk, <i>(which I also know nothing about)</i>, or if they were designed that way for 
some other reason.&nbsp; In my opinion, it would have been better from an 
educational viewpoint for Scratch to use a more conventional C-style loop structure 
based on the keywords <i>while</i>, <i>for</i>, and possibly <i>do while</i>.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Scratch is a dead-end IDE</b></font></p>
<p>The bottom line is that Scratch simply wasn't designed to teach students how 
to do serious programming.&nbsp; While it may be educational with respect to the 
effective use of multimedia capability, <i>(and it is very successful in giving 
young students constructive outlets for their creative energies)</i>, insofar as computer science education is 
concerned, Scratch is a dead-end IDE.&nbsp; Scratch is clearly not suitable for major 
programming projects.&nbsp; Further, there is no evidence that the folks in the 
Scratch program at MIT are working on a smooth migration path for students from 
Scratch to any serious programming language.</p>
<h4><a name="What_about_Alice">What about Alice?</a></h4>
<p>The latest released version of Alice is version 2.0.&nbsp; <i>(Version 2.2 has 
been released in beta as of this writing.)</i>&nbsp; Alice 3.0 is on the drawing 
board.&nbsp; I will divide this discussion between Alice 2.0 and Alice 3.0.&nbsp; 
<i>(Alice 2.2 doesn't appear to be significantly different from 2.0 insofar as 
this discussion is concerned, so I will skip 
it altogether.)</i></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Alice 2.0 is also fun and engaging</b></font></p>
<p>Alice 2.0 is a 3D programming language, which is also a lot of fun.&nbsp; 
However, it is more difficult to use than Scratch and may not be as much fun as Scratch.&nbsp; <i>(Alice provides much less in the way of multimedia functionality 
than Scratch.)</i>&nbsp; Alice 2.0 is much 
more powerful and more conventional than Scratch, but is still somewhat 
unconventional nonetheless.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Alice supports most fundamental programming concepts</b></font></p>
<p>Alice supports almost all of the fundamental programming concepts that I referred to
<a href="#Of_the_ten_to_fifteen">earlier</a>.&nbsp; I personally consider Alice 
2.0 to be suitable for use in a first programming course for community-college 
students who don't have a strong programming background from high school.&nbsp; 
However, almost all of my colleagues in the computer science department in the 
college where I 
teach disagree with me on this.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>A drag and drop programming interface</b></font></p>
<p>Both Alice 2.0 and Scratch use a drag and drop programming interface.&nbsp; 
Scratch programmers are totally insulated from anything resembling source code.&nbsp; 
Alice 2.0 students are required to create source code using the drag and drop 
interface, but they are not required to memorize syntax.&nbsp; My colleagues 
seem to uniformly agree that this is a major failing of Alice.&nbsp; Many Alice 
students simply don't learn syntax because they are not forced to do so.&nbsp; 
According to my colleagues, this places them at a disadvantage when they enroll 
in the next programming course in the computer science curriculum.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Alice 2.0 is also not a serious programming language</b></font></p>
<p>To compound matters, Alice 2.0 is also not a serious programming language.&nbsp; By this, I mean that no one is going to use Alice 2.0 for any serious 
programming projects.&nbsp; Even though Alice 2.0 was developed using Java, the 
underlying language is completely hidden in Alice 2.0.&nbsp; The bottom line is 
that Alice 2.0 is strictly for teaching.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>A difficult transition is required</b></font></p>
<p>Alice 
2.0 students must transition to a serious programming language such as Java, C#, or 
C++ if they are going to continue their computer programming education beyond 
the first semester.&nbsp; There is no smooth migration path from either Scratch 
or Alice 2.0 to a serious programming language.&nbsp; According to my 
colleagues, this is a major drawback of Alice 2.0.&nbsp; <i>(I doubt that they 
would even be willing to discuss Scratch.)</i>&nbsp; They 
believe that many students who successfully complete an introductory programming 
course using Alice 2.0 are still not prepared to make the transition into the 
next programming course in the computer science curriculum.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Alice 3.0 will be a serious programming language - 
Java</b></font></p>
<p>The folks at Carnegie Mellon University <i>(CMU)</i> 
are currently hard at work to solve most of the problems that I described above 
including a smooth migration path to a serious programming language.&nbsp; 
That solution will come in the form of Alice 3.0.</p>
<p>Alice 3.0 will make it relatively easy to develop 3D games and 
animations just like Alice 2.0, and will also provide a drag and drop 
programming interface.&nbsp; However, and this is extremely important, Alice 3.0 will 
also expose the full power of Java.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The programming interface will be optional</b></font></p>
<p>The 
programming interface that is used with Alice 3.0, whether it is drag and drop 
or text editor, 
will be optional.&nbsp; Students will be able to program in either or both ways.&nbsp; 
As I understand it, the Alice 3.0 interface will sit atop Eclipse, which is 
already a very popular professional Java IDE.</p>
<p><a name="According_to">
According to</a> the folks at CMU, a capable programmer will be able to do 
anything with Alice 3.0 that can be done with Java.&nbsp; While Alice 2.0 is 
also a dead-end IDE <i>(albeit much more powerful than Scratch)</i>, if the
<a href="#According_to">above statement</a> holds true, there will be nothing 
dead end about Alice 3.0.&nbsp; With the full power of Java and a built-in 
Eclipse IDE, Alice 3.0 will be capable of carrying students all the way from introductory 
programming to professional employment.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Now for the bad news</b></font></p>
<p>That's the good news.&nbsp; The bad news is that the release schedule for 
Alice 3.0 continues to slip, and the latest estimate for release of a non-beta 
version is sometime around the fall of 2009.</p>
<h4><a name="Where_does_greenfoot_fit_in_the_mix">Where does Greenfoot fit in 
the mix?</a></h4>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Greenfoot is not a dead-end IDE</b></font></p>
<p>Unlike Scratch and Alice 2.0, Greenfoot is not a dead-end IDE because it 
exposes and supports the full power of Java.&nbsp; In short, Greenfoot is a Java 
IDE that has been specialized to make programming fun and engaging for beginning 
programmers.</p>
<p>Although you would probably prefer to use NetBeans or Eclipse for large 
programming projects, you could develop large projects using Greenfoot if you 
chose to do so.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Requires students to learn and use Java syntax</b></font></p>
<p>Also, because Greenfoot lacks a drag and drop programming 
interface and requires the students to learn and use Java syntax, it should make my 
colleagues happy.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Greenfoot is a very good starting point</b></font></p>
<p>Students can go as far using Greenfoot as they choose to go.&nbsp; There are virtually no issues having to do with migrating 
from Greenfoot to a serious 
programming language.&nbsp; Greenfoot is already an IDE for a serious programming 
language -- Java.</p>
<p>Of course, when 
students reach an intermediate to high level of Java programming proficiency, they 
will probably choose to 
switch over to a more professional IDE such as NetBeans or Eclipse.&nbsp; Along 
the way, they may choose to take a look at BlueJ or JGrasp.&nbsp; In the 
early days of learning to program, however, both NetBeans and Eclipse are 
overkill.&nbsp; 
Furthermore, NetBeans, Eclipse, BlueJ, and JGrasp don't provide the 
features of Greenfoot that are designed to engage programming students and to 
keep them interested until they are ready for an IDE like NetBeans.</p>

<p>When I first became involved with Greenfoot, I discovered that my Firefox 
browser had not updated itself beyond Java 1.4 even though it had gone through 
numerous update cycles and everything else on my computer was running Java 1.6.&nbsp;
<i>(Firefox seemed to be really fond of Java 1.4.)</i>&nbsp; In the end, I had to go to the Control Panel and remove an old 
Java 1.4 JRE that was still on my computer to force Firefox to update itself to 
use Java 1.6.</p>
<center>
<h2><a name="Run the program"></a>Run the program</h2>
</center>
<p>I invite you to go to Greenfoot Home <i>(see <a href="#Resources">Resources</a>)</i> where you can 
download and install Greenfoot.&nbsp; As of this writing, Greenfoot version 
1.4.1 is the latest release.&nbsp; I'm told, however, that version 1.4.5 will be 
released very soon, perhaps before this tutorial is actually published.</p>
<p>Also if you need to do so, go to Sun, download and install the latest version 
of Java <i>(see <a href="#Resources">Resources</a>)</i>.&nbsp; Remember, 
Greenfoot requires Java 1.5 or later, and as of this writing Java 1.6 is 
available from Sun.&nbsp; According to recent correspondence with Michael 
Kölling,</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>&quot;If, at installation time, Greenfoot finds only one Java version on 
	the system (JDK install, not JRE), it will just use it. (Must be 
Java 5 or up.) If it finds more than one Java version, it asks the user at 
installation time which one to use. This can be changed later.&quot;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you computer is ready, use the code in Listing 1 and Listing 2, along with the written 
instructions in this tutorial to create and execute the simple scenario that I described 
earlier.&nbsp; Experiment with the code, making changes, and 
observing the results of your changes.&nbsp; Make certain that you can explain why 
your changes behave as they do. </p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>My purpose in publishing this tutorial is to make the case that the Greenfoot 
IDE is quite possibly the best IDE available at this time for teaching a beginning 
course in computer programming.&nbsp; Because Greenfoot exposes the full power of Java, 
it may also prove useful in a second-semester programming course that 
concentrates on object-oriented programming.&nbsp; I am considering the 
incorporation of Greenfoot in a variety of ways into the second-semester Java/OOP course that I 
routinely teach each semester.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>No major scenarios in this lesson</b></font></p>
<p>Most of the tutorial lessons that I publish contain at least one fairly 
substantial sample program.&nbsp; However, that is not the case for this 
tutorial.&nbsp; My main purpose in publishing this tutorial was simply to 
introduce you to Greenfoot in terms of its capabilities and its operation.&nbsp; I will 
publish other lessons in the future that will show you how to put Greenfoot to 
work in more significant ways.</p>
