<h2>
<a NAME="Preface"></a>Preface</h2></center>
This is one in a series of lessons designed to teach you about
Digital Signal Processing (DSP) using Java.&nbsp; The purpose of the miniseries
is to present the concepts of DSP in a way that can be understood by persons
having no prior DSP experience.&nbsp; However, some experience in Java
programming would be useful.&nbsp; Whenever it is necessary for me to
write a program to illustrate a point, I will write it in Java.

<p>You may find it useful to open another copy of this lesson in a separate
browser window.&nbsp; That will make it easier for you to scroll back and
forth among the different figures  while you are reading about
them.

<p>I recommend that you also study the other lessons in my extensive collection 
of online programming tutorials. You will find a consolidated index of my online 
tutorial lessons at <font color="#000000"><a href="http://www.DickBaldwin.com">
www.DickBaldwin.com</a>.</font><p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Some of what you have 
previously learned</b></font><p>In a previous lesson, I explained the meaning of sampling, and 
discussed some of the problems that occur as a result of high-frequency 
components in the analog signal.<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Measure and record 
the signal amplitude</b></font><p>I told you that to sample an analog signal means to measure and record its 
amplitude at a series of points in time.&nbsp; The values that you record 
constitute a <i>sampled time series </i>intended to represent the analog 
signal.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Avoiding frequency folding</b></font></p>
<p>I told you that to avoid problems, the sampling frequency must be a least 
twice as great as the highest frequency component contained in the analog 
signal, and as a practical matter, should probably be somewhat higher.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Sinusoids, frequency, and period</b></font></p>
<p>I introduced you to sinusoids, taught you about sine and cosine functions, 
and introduced  the concepts of period and frequency for sinusoids.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Decomposition of time series</b></font></p>
<p>I told you that almost everything we will discuss in this series on DSP is 
based on the premise that every time series can be decomposed into a large 
number of sinusoids, each having its own amplitude and frequency.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The notion of DSP</b></font></p>
<p>I told you that DSP is based on the notion that signals in nature can be 
sampled and converted into a series of numbers.&nbsp; The numbers can be fed 
into some sort of digital device, which can process the numbers to achieve some 
desired objective.</p>

<p>This is a broad-ranging lesson.&nbsp; It begins with a discussion of 
averaging time series,  ends with a discussion of spectral resolution, and covers 
several related topics in between.&nbsp; Don't be 
alarmed, however, at the range of the lesson.&nbsp; The topics of time-series 
averaging and spectral resolution are very strongly related.</p>
<p>I will discuss why we frequently need to average sampled 
time series, and explain some of the issues involved in that process.</p>
<p>I will also show you the impact of those averaging issues on DSP, using 
spectrum analysis as an example.</p>
<center>
<h2>
<a NAME="Discussion and Sample Programs"></a><font color="#000000">Discussion</font></h2></center>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me how something as mathematically complex as DSP 
can be distilled down to the simplest of computational processes.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Which screw to turn ...</b></font></p>
<p>DSP reminds me of the old story about the customer who complained about the 
bill at the auto repair shop being too high.&nbsp; According to the customer, 
all the mechanic did to fix the problem was  turn one screw, and the bill was too 
high for the labor involved.&nbsp; The mechanic responded that he didn't charge 
for turning the screw.&nbsp; Rather, he charged for knowing which screw to turn, 
and knowing which way to turn it.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Turning the screws in DSP</b></font></p>
<p>Knowing how to turn the screw is not the complicated part of DSP.&nbsp; 
Rather, the complicated part of DSP lies in  knowing which screw to turn and which way 
to turn it.&nbsp; Once you know that, you will be surprised  just how 
easy it is to actually turn the screw.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Computing the average value of a time series</b></font></p>
<p>As you will learn in this series of lessons, a large majority of DSP operations consist 
simply of the following two steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiply one time series by another time series, to produce a third time 
  series.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Compute the average value of the third time series.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>In many cases, it is the average value of the third time series that provides 
the answer you are seeking.</p>
<p>The challenge is in knowing what the average value means, and how to 
interpret it.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Decomposition of time series</b></font></p>
<p>Almost everything that we will discuss in this series on 
DSP is based on the premise that every time series can be decomposed into a 
<i>(potentially large)</i> number of sinusoids, each having its own amplitude and frequency.</p>
<p>Suppose, for example, that we have two time series, each of which is composed of 
two sinusoidal components as follows:</p>
<p><b><font face="monospace" size="2">f(x) = cos(ax) + cos (bx)<br>
g(x) = cos(cx) + cos(dx)</font></b></p>
<p>The product of the two time series is given by:</p>
<p><b><font face="monospace" size="2">h(x) = f(x)*g(x)</font></b><br>
<b><font face="monospace" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = (cos(ax) + cos (bx)) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
* (cos(cx) + cos(dx))</font></b></p>
<p>where the asterisk (*) means multiplication.</p>
<p>Multiplying this out produces the following:</p>
<p><b><font face="monospace" size="2">h(x) = cos(ax)*cos(cx) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
+ cos(ax)*cos(dx) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
+
cos(bx)*cos(cx) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
+ cos(bx)*cos(dx)</font></b></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>A sum of products of sinusoids</b></font></p>
<p>Thus, the time series produced by multiplying any two time series consists of 
the sum of a <i>(potentially large)</i> number of terms, each of which is the 
product of two sinusoids.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The product of two sinusoids</b></font></p>
<p>We probably need to learn a little about the product of two 
sinusoids.&nbsp; I will discuss this topic with a little more mathematical rigor 
in a future lesson.&nbsp; In this lesson, however, I will simply illustrate the 
topic using graphs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Important:</b>&nbsp; <b>The product of two sinusoids is always a new time series, 
which is the sum of two new sinusoids.&nbsp; </b> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The frequencies of the new sinusoids</b></font></p>
<p>The frequencies of the new sinusoids are different from the frequencies of 
the original sinusoids.&nbsp; Furthermore, the frequency of one of the new 
sinusoids may be zero.</p>
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="400" BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" >
<tr>
<td>
<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000"><b>What is a sinusoid with zero frequency?</b></font><p align="left">
As a practical matter, a sinusoid with zero frequency is simply a constant 
value.&nbsp; It plots as a horizontal straight line.<p align="left">Think of it 
this way.&nbsp; As the frequency of the sinusoid approaches zero, the period, <i>
(which is the 
reciprocal of frequency),</i> approaches infinity.&nbsp; Thus, the width of the first 
lobe of the sinusoid widens, causing every value in that lobe to be the same as 
the first value.<p align="left">This will become a very important concept as we 
pursue DSP operations.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Sum and difference frequencies</b></font></p>

<p>More specifically, when you multiply two sinusoids, the frequency of one of 
the  sinusoids in the new time series is the sum of the frequencies of  the two sinusoids that were multiplied.&nbsp; The frequency of the other sinusoid in the new time series is the difference between the frequencies of 
 
the two sinusoids that were multiplied.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>An important special case</b></font></p>

<p>For the special case where the two original sinusoids have the same 
frequency, the difference frequency is zero and one of the  sinusoids in the new 
time series has 
a frequency of zero.&nbsp; It is this special case that makes digital filtering and 
digital spectrum analysis possible.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Many sinusoidal products</b></font></p>

<p>When we multiply two time series and compute the average of the resulting 
time series, we are in effect computing the average of the products of all the 
individual sinusoidal components contained in the two time series.&nbsp; That 
is, the new time series contains the products of <i>(potentially many)</i> 
individual sinusoids contained in the two original time series.&nbsp; In the 
end, it all comes down to computing the average value of products of sinusoids.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Product of sinusoids with same frequency</b></font></p>

<p>The product of any pair of sinusoids that have the same frequency will 
produce a time series containing the sum of two sinusoids.&nbsp; One of the 
sinusoids will have a frequency of zero <i>(hence it will have a constant value).</i>&nbsp; The other sinusoid will have a 
frequency that is double the frequency of the original sinusoids.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The ideal average value</b></font></p>

<p>Ideally, the average value of the new time series 
will be equal to the constant value of the sinusoid with zero frequency.&nbsp; 
This is because, ideally, the average value of the other sinusoid will be zero.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Product of sinusoids with different frequencies</b></font></p>

<p>The product of any pair of sinusoids that do not have the same frequency will 
produce a new time series containing the sum of two sinusoids.&nbsp; One of the 
new sinusoids will have a frequency that is the sum of the frequencies of the 
two original sinusoids.&nbsp; The other sinusoid will have a frequency that is 
the difference between the frequencies of the two original sinusoids.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Ideal average value is zero</b></font></p>

<p>Ideally, the average value of the new time series in this case will be equal to 
zero, because ideally the average value of each of the sinusoids that make up 
the time series will be zero.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Oops!</b></font></p>

<p>As we will see later, we don't always achieve the ideal.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Examples of products of sinusoids</b></font></p>

<p>Let's examine some time series produced by multiplying  sinusoids.&nbsp; Figures 1, 2, and 3 show the results of multiplying sinusoids 
having the same and different frequencies.&nbsp; Consider first the plots in Figure 1.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00108figb.gif" width="409" height="431"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 1 Products of sinusoids</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Multiplying sinusoids with same frequency</b></font></p>
<p>The top plot in Figure 1 shows a sinusoid whose frequency and sampling rate 
are such that it has 32 samples per cycle.&nbsp; The second plot from the top in 
Figure 1 is identical to the top plot.&nbsp; <i>(To simplify the explanation, 
these two sinusoids are also cosine functions.)</i></p>
<p>The third plot down from the top in Figure 1 shows the product of these two 
sinusoids, which have the same frequency.&nbsp; If you examine the third plot, you will notice several important 
characteristics.&nbsp;  </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>A double-frequency sinusoid</b></font></p>
<p>By 
matching the peaks, you can determine that the frequency of the sinusoid in the 
third plot is double the frequency of each of the  top two plots.&nbsp; <i>(This is the 
sum of the frequencies of the two sinusoids that were multiplied together.)</i></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Half the amplitude with a positive bias</b></font></p>
<p>Next, you will notice that the amplitude of the sinusoid in the third plot is 
half that of each of the first two plots.&nbsp; In addition, the entire sinusoid in the third plot is in the positive value range.&nbsp; </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The sum of two sinusoids</b></font></p>
<p>The third plot is actually the sum of two 
sinusoids.&nbsp; One of the sinusoids has a frequency of zero, giving a constant 
value of 0.5.&nbsp; This constant value of 0.5 is added to all the values in the 
other sinusoid, causing it to be plotted in the positive value region.</p>
<p>Later on, we will compute the average value of the time series in the third 
plot, and ideally, that average value will be the constant value produced by the 
zero-frequency sinusoid.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Product of sinusoids with different frequencies</b></font></p>
<p>Now consider the bottom two plots in Figure 1.&nbsp; The fourth plot down 
from the top is a cosine function whose frequency is almost, but not quite the same as 
the frequency of the sinusoid in the top plot.&nbsp; The sinusoid in the top 
plot has 32 samples per cycle while the sinusoid in the fourth plot has 31 
samples per cycle.</p>
<p>The time series in the bottom plot is the product of the time series in the 
first and fourth plots.&nbsp; </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The sum of two sinusoids</b></font></p>
<p>Once again, this time series is the sum of two sinusoids, one whose frequency 
is the difference between the two original frequencies, and one whose frequency 
is the sum of the two original frequencies.</p>
<p>However, in this case, the difference frequency is not zero.&nbsp; Rather, it 
is a very low frequency.&nbsp; What you see in the bottom plot of Figure 1 is a 
sinusoid whose frequency is the sum of the two original frequencies added to a 
sinusoid whose frequency is the difference between the two original frequencies.&nbsp; 
Because the two original frequencies were almost equal, the frequency of the 
second sinusoid is very low.</p>
<p>As you can see, the low-frequency component in the bottom plot in Figure 1 appears to be the beginning of a cosine 
function whose period is 
much greater than the width of the plot <i>(400 points).</i></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Another view of the same data</b></font></p>
<p>Figure 2 shows another view of the bottom two plots from Figure 1.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00108figd.gif" width="403" height="199"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 2 Products of sinusoids</p>
<p>The difference between Figure 2 and Figure 1 is that while Figure 1 shows 
only 400 points along the x-axis, Figure 2 shows 1200 points along the x-axis.&nbsp; 
Thus, the horizontal scale in Figure 2 is significantly compressed relative to 
the horizontal scale in Figure 1.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>More than one cycle</b></font></p>
<p>Figure 2 lets you see a little more than one full cycle of the low-frequency 
component of the  time series produced by multiplying the two sinusoids.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left"><i>(Figure 2 does not provide a  very good representation of 
the high-frequency component.&nbsp; This is because I plotted 1200 points in a 
part of the screen that is only 400 pixels wide.&nbsp; On my computer, I can 
expand this to the full screen width.&nbsp; However, I can't publish it at that 
width, so I published the 400-pixel version.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Averaging can be problematic in this case</b></font></p>
<p>Later on, we will compute the average value of the time series represented by 
the bottom plot in Figures 1 and 2.&nbsp; Ideally, that average value will be 
zero.&nbsp; However, you have probably already figured out that a great many 
data points must be included in the computation of the average to get anything 
near zero.&nbsp; An eyeball estimate indicates that about 900 data points are 
required just to include a single cycle of the low-frequency component.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>More examples of the products of sinusoids</b></font></p>
<p>Figure 3 shows two additional time series created by multiplying sinusoids.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00108figc.gif" width="409" height="431"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 3 Products of sinusoids</p>
<p>The arrangement in Figure 3 is the same as in Figure 1.&nbsp; The top plot in 
Figure 3 is the same sinusoid shown in the top plot of Figure 1.&nbsp; This is a 
sinusoid with 32 samples per cycle.</p>
<p>Immediately below the top sinusoid in Figure 3 is another sinusoid.&nbsp; 
This sinusoid has 24 cycles per cycle.&nbsp; As you can see, the frequency of 
this sinusoid is a little higher than the frequency of the sinusoid in the top 
plot.</p>
<p>The time series in the third plot down from the top is the product of the 
time series in the  top two plots.&nbsp; Again, this time series is composed of 
two new sinusoids whose frequencies are the sum of and difference between the two 
original frequencies.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>A greater frequency difference</b></font></p>
<p>Because the frequency difference between the first two plots in Figure 3 is considerably greater 
than was the case for the bottom plot of Figure 1, the frequency of the low frequency component of 
the third plot in Figure 3 is considerably greater than was the case in 
Figure 1.</p>
<p>Later on, we will compute the average value of the third plot in 
Figure 3.&nbsp; Ideally, the average value will be zero.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>An even greater frequency difference</b></font></p>
<p>The fourth plot in Figure 3 shows a sinusoid having 16 samples per cycle.&nbsp; 
The frequency of this sinusoid is double the frequency of the sinusoid in the 
top plot.</p>
<p>The bottom curve in Figure 3 shows the product of the first and fourth plots.&nbsp; As usual, this time series consists of the sum of two sinusoids 
whose frequencies are the sum and the difference of the original frequencies.</p>
<p>We will compute the average value of the bottom plot later on.&nbsp; 
Ideally, the average value will be zero.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>What is the average value of a sinusoid?</b></font></p>
<p>Hopefully by now you understand why we need to be concerned about the average 
value of a sinusoid.</p>
<p>Consider Figure 4, which shows five different sampled sinusoids with 
different frequencies.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00108figa.gif" width="401" height="431"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 4 Five Sampled Sinusoids</p>
<p>We may be tempted to say that the average value of a 
sinusoid is zero.&nbsp; After all, the positive lobes of the sinusoid are shaped 
exactly like the negative lobes.&nbsp; <i>Therefore, every positive value is offset by a 
corresponding negative value.</i></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Is that a true statement?</b></font></p>
<p>Every positive value is offset by a corresponding negative value only if you compute the average over an even number 
of cycles of the sinusoid.&nbsp; For example, it is pretty obvious that if you 
compute the average on the 64 data values shown for the bottom plot in Figure 4, 
the result will not be zero.&nbsp; Rather, it will be a positive non-zero value.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Sample average values</b></font></p>
<p>Next we will take a look at the computed average values of the time series 
from Figures 1 and 3 that were produced by multiplying sinusoids.</p>
<p>The black curve in Figure 5 shows an expanded view of the sinusoidal curve from the top half of 
the third plot in Figure 1 <i>(recall that the bottom half of that plot was 
empty, so I didn't include it in Figure 5).&nbsp; </i>This curve was the result of multiplying two sinusoids with the same 
frequency.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00108fige.gif" width="409" height="431"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 5 Computed average value of a time series</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The average value</b></font></p>
<p>The red curve in Figure 5 shows the computed average value as a function of 
the number of points included in the average.&nbsp; In other words, a particular 
point on the red curve in figure 5 represents the average value of all the points on the 
black curve to the left of and including that point on the black curve.</p>
<p>The blue horizontal line if Figure 5 shows the ideal average value for this 
situation.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Result converges on the ideal</b></font></p>
<p>As more and more points are included in the average, the values 
of the positive and negative peaks on the red curve approach the ideal blue line 
asymptotically <i>(except for a slight positive bias, which is the result of the 
sampling process).</i></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>An expanded view</b></font></p>
<p>Figure 6 shows a greatly expanded view of the red average values in Figure 5.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00108figf.gif" width="409" height="431"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 6 Expanded average value of a time series</p>
<p>The ideal value for this average is 0.5, and that is the value represented by 
the blue line.&nbsp; The plot in Figure 6 shows the same horizontal scale as 
Figure 5.&nbsp; However, the entire vertical plotting area in Figure 6 
represents the values from 0.48 to 0.52.&nbsp; </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Ideal value is never reached</b></font></p>
<p>As you can see, the ideal value is never reached in Figure 6 except at 
isolated points where the red curve crosses the horizontal line.&nbsp; Even if I 
extended the horizontal axis to 1200 or more points, that would continue 
to be the case.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>A more serious case</b></font></p>
<p>Figure 7 computes and displays the average value of the bottom plot in 
Figure 2 <i>(recall that this plot shows 1200 points on the horizontal axis, whereas 
Figure 5 shows only 400 points on the horizontal axis).</i> Recall also that this time series was produced by multiplying two sinusoids having 
nearly the same frequency.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00108figg.gif" width="409" height="429"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 7 Computed average value of a time series</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Red curve is the average</b></font></p>
<p>As before, the black curve in Figure 7 shows the time series, and the red 
curve shows the computed average value as a function of the number of points 
included in the average.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left"><i>(In this case, I didn't even bother to show the 
short axis containing only 400 points.&nbsp; The horizontal axis in Figure 7 
contains 1200 points, the same as in Figure 2.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The ideal average value is zero</b></font></p>
<p>In this case, the ideal average value is zero, as indicated by the green 
horizontal axis.&nbsp; As you can see, even for a 1200-point averaging window, the 
average value deviates significantly from the ideal.&nbsp; We will see the 
detrimental impact of 
this problem later when I perform spectral analysis in an attempt to separate 
two closely-spaced peaks in the frequency spectrum.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Some additional examples of average values</b></font></p>
<p>Figure 8 computes and displays the average value of the third plot 
down from the top  in Figure 3. This plot was produced by multiplying the 
two sinusoids in the top two plots in Figure 3.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00108figh.gif" width="409" height="431"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 8 Computed average value of a time series</p>
<p>As before, the black curve in Figure 8 represents the time series, and the 
red curve represents the average value of the time series as a function of the 
number of points included in the average.</p>
<p>For this case also, the ideal average value is zero, as represented by the 
green horizontal axis.&nbsp; The positive and negative peaks in the red average 
value can be seen to approach the ideal value asymptotically within the 
400 horizontal points plotted in Figure 8.</p>
<p>Figure 9 computes and displays the average value of the bottom plot in 
Figure 3. This time series was produced by multiplying the top plot in 
Figure 3 by the fourth plot in Figure 3.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="dsp00108figi.gif" width="409" height="431"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 9 Computed average value of a time series</p>
<p>Once again, the black curve in Figure 9 represents the time series, and the 
red curve represents the average value of the time series as a function of the 
number of points included in the average.&nbsp; In this case, the average 
converges on zero rather nicely within the 400 points included on the horizontal 
axis.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>A short recap before continuing</b></font></p>
<p>Hopefully, by this point, you understand how multiplying two time series 
produces a new time series composed of the sum of all the products of the 
individual sinusoids in the two original time series.</p>
<p>When each pair of sinusoids is multiplied together, they produce a new time 
series consisting of two other 
sinusoids whose frequencies are the sum and difference of the original pair of 
frequencies.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The error in the computed average</b></font></p>
<p>When an average is computed for a fixed number of points on the new time series, the error in the average tends to be greater for 
cases where the original frequency values were close together.&nbsp; This is because the period of one of the 
new sinusoids becomes longer as the original frequencies become closer.&nbsp; In 
general, the longer the period of the sinusoid, the more points are required to 
get a good estimate of its average value.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Does this matter?</b></font></p>
<p>There are many operations in DSP where this matters a lot.&nbsp; As mentioned 
earlier,  the computational requirements for 
 
DSP frequently boil down to nothing more than multiplying a pair 
of time series and computing the average of the product.&nbsp; You will see many 
examples of this as you continue studying the lessons in 
this series of tutorials on DSP.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Spectral analysis</b></font></p>
<p>I am going to illustrate my point by showing you one such example in this 
lesson.&nbsp; This example will use a Fourier transform in an attempt to perform 
spectral analysis and to separate two closely-spaced frequency components in a 
time series.&nbsp; As you will see, errors in the computed average can interfere 
with this process in a significant way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>(This example will illustrate and explain the results using graphs.&nbsp; 
Future lessons will provide more technical details on the DSP operations 
involved.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Several steps</b></font></p>
<p>I will provide this illustration in several steps.&nbsp; </p>
<p>First, I will show you spectral data for several time series, each consisting 
of a single sinusoid.&nbsp; The time series will have different lengths but the 
individual sinusoids will have the same frequency.&nbsp; This will serve as baseline data for the experiments that 
follow.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Sum of two sinusoids</b></font></p>
<p>Then I will show you spectral data for several time series, each composed of 
the sum of two sinusoids.&nbsp; These time series will have different lengths.&nbsp; 
The sinusoids in each time series will have the same frequencies.&nbsp; I will 
show you two cases that fall under this description.&nbsp; The 
frequency difference for the two sinusoids in each time series will be small in 
one case, and greater in another case.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Sinusoids with different frequency differences</b></font></p>
<p>Finally, I will show you spectral data for several time series, each composed 
of the sum of two sinusoids.&nbsp; These time series will be different lengths, 
and the sinusoids in each time series will have different frequencies.&nbsp; In 
particular, the frequency difference between the two sinusoids in each time 
series will be equal to the theoretical <i>frequency resolution</i> for a time 
series of that particular length.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The Fourier transform</b></font></p>
<p>In order to perform the spectral analysis, I will perform a Fourier transform on the time series to transform that data 
into the frequency domain.&nbsp; Then I will plot the data in the frequency 
domain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>(This lesson will not provide  technical details on the Fourier 
transform.&nbsp; That information will be forthcoming in a future lesson.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Keeping it simple</b></font></p>
<p>To keep this explanation as simple as possible, I will stipulate that all of 
the sinusoids contained in the time series are cosine functions.&nbsp; There are 
no sine functions in the time series.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>(If the time series did contain sine functions, the process would still 
work, but the explanation would be  more complicated.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>A brief description of the Fourier transform</b></font></p>
<p>Before I get into the results, I will provide a very brief description of how I performed 
the Fourier transform for these experiments.</p>
<p>The following steps were 
performed at each frequency in a set of 400 uniformly spaced frequencies across the frequency range  from zero to the folding frequency.</p>
<p>The steps were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the time series was shorter than 400 points, extend it to 400 points by 
  appending zero-valued points at the end.</li>
  <li>Select the next frequency of interest.</li>
  <li>Generate a cosine function, 400 samples in length, at that frequency.</li>
  <li>Multiply the cosine function by the time series.</li>
  <li>Compute the average value of the time series  produced by 
  multiplying the cosine function by the time series.</li>
  <li>Save the average value.&nbsp; Call it the <i>real</i> value for later 
  reference.</li>
  <li>Generate a sine function, 400 samples in length, at the same frequency.</li>
  <li>Multiply the sine function by the time series.</li>
  <li>Compute the average value of the time series  produced by 
  multiplying the sine function by the time series.</li>
  <li>Save the average value.&nbsp; Call it the <i>imaginary</i> value for later 
  reference.</li>
  <li>Compute the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and 
  imaginary values.&nbsp; This is the value of interest.&nbsp; Plot it.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Why does this work?</b></font></p>
<p>No matter how many sinusoidal components are contained in the time series, 
only one <i>(if any)</i> of those sinusoidal components will match the selected frequency.&nbsp; 
 
</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Multiply by the cosine and average the product</b></font></p>
<p>When that matching component is multiplied by the cosine function having the 
selected frequency, the new time series 
created by the multiplication will consist of a constant value plus a sinusoid whose frequency is twice the 
selected frequency.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The computed average value of this time series will converge on the value of 
the constant with the quality of the estimate depending on the number of points 
included in the average.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Multiply by the sine and average the product</b></font></p>
<p>Since the sinusoids in the time series are stipulated to be  cosine 
functions, when the sinusoid with the matching frequency is multiplied by the sine function, the new time series will 
consist of a constant value of zero plus a sinusoid whose frequency is twice the 
frequency of the sine function.</p>
<p>The computed average of this time series will converge on zero with the 
quality of the estimate depending on the number of points in the average.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>(As mentioned earlier, this process would work even if the time series contained 
sinusoids other than cosine functions.&nbsp; However, the explanation would be 
more complicated.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>What about the other sinusoidal components?</b></font></p>
<p>Every other sinusoidal component in the time series <i>(whose frequency 
doesn't match the selected frequency),</i> will produce a new time series containing two sinusoids 
when multiplied by the sine function or the cosine function.</p>
<p>The frequency of one of the sinusoids in the new time series will be the sum of the 
frequencies of the sinusoidal component and the sine or cosine function.&nbsp; The 
frequency of the other sinusoid will be the difference in the frequencies 
between the 
sinusoidal component and the sine or cosine function.</p>
<p>As you saw earlier, 
when this difference is very 
small, the frequency of the new sinusoid will be very near to zero.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The average value for non-matching components</b></font></p>
<p>Ideally, the average value of the product should be zero when the frequency 
of the original sinusoidal component is different from the sine or cosine 
function by which it is multiplied.&nbsp; The computed average of this time 
series will converge on zero with the quality of the estimate depending on the 
number of points in the average.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Measurement error</b></font></p>
<p>However, <i>(and this is very important),</i> when the frequency of the original 
sinusoid is very close to the frequency of the sine or cosine function, the 
convergence on zero 
will be poor even for a large number of points in the average.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Thus, the computation at those 
frequencies very near to the frequency of an actual sinusoidal 
component in the raw data will produce a non-zero average value even when there is no 
sinusoidal component in the raw data at those frequencies.&nbsp; This is a form of measurement 
error.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Let's see some data</b></font></p>
<p>With that as a preface, lets look at some graphs <i>(Figures 10 and 11)</i> resulting from spectral 
analyses.&nbsp; <i>(These two figures show two 
different views of the same data.)</i></p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00108figj.gif" width="409" height="431"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 10 Spectrum of five different sinusoids of different 
lengths</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Five sinusoids, same frequency, different lengths</b></font></p>
<p>Figure 10 shows the individual spectra computed for five different sinusoids, 
each 
having the same frequency, but different lengths.&nbsp; The combination of 
sampling rate and frequency was such that each sinusoid had 32 samples per 
cycle.</p>
<p>Starting at the top in Figure 10, the  lengths of the five sinusoids were 80,
160,
240,
320, and
400 samples.&nbsp; <i>(The lengths of the five sinusoids were multiples of 80 
samples.)</i></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Extend to 400 samples for computation</b></font></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, for the cases where the actual length of the sinusoid was less than 400 
samples, the length was extended to 400 samples by appending an appropriate 
number of samples having zero values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>(This made it easy to compute and plot the spectrum for every sinusoid 
over the same frequency range with the same number of points in each plot.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spectrum was computed and plotted for each sinusoid at 400 
individual frequency points between zero and the folding frequency.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The actual averaging window</b></font></p>
<p>Even though the Fourier transform program averaged across 400 samples in all 
cases, the <i>effective</i> averaging length was equal to the 
length of the sinusoid.&nbsp; All product points outside that length had a value 
of zero and contributed nothing to the average one way or the other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>(I also applied an additional scale factor to the spectral results to 
compensate for the fact that fewer total samples were included in the average 
for the short samples.&nbsp; This caused the amplitude of the peak in the 
spectrum to nominally the same in all five cases.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>A horizontally-expanded plot</b></font></p>
<p>As you can see in Figure 10, there isn't much in the spectra to the right of 
about 50 spectral points.&nbsp; That is as it should be since the single sinusoid in 
each 
time series was at the low end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>Figure 11 shows the same data as Figure 10 with only the 
first 50 frequency points  plotted on the horizontal axis.&nbsp; The remaining 
350 frequency points were simply ignored.&nbsp; This provides a much better view 
of the structure of the peaks in the different spectra.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00108figk.gif" width="409" height="431"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 11 Spectrum of five different sinusoids of different 
lengths</p>
<p>I will begin the discussion with the bottom plot in Figure 11, which is the computed 
spectrum for the single sinusoid having a length of 400 samples.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>A spectral line</b></font></p>
<p>Ideally, since the time series was a single sinusoid, the spectrum should 
consist of a single non-zero value at the frequency of the sinusoid, <i>(often 
referred to as a spectral line)</i> and every 
other value in the spectrum should be zero.</p>
<p>However, because the computation of the 
spectrum involves the computation of average values resulting from the products 
of sinusoids, the ideal is not always achieved.&nbsp; In order to achieve the ideal, it 
would be necessary to multiply and average over an infinite number of points.&nbsp; 
Anything short of that will result in some measurement error, as exhibited by 
the bottom plot in Figure 11.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>(The bottom plot in Figure 11 has a large peak in the center with every 
second point to the left and right of center having a  zero value.&nbsp; I 
will explain this structure in more detail later.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Spectra of shorter sinusoids</b></font></p>
<p>Moving from the bottom to the top in Figure 11, each individual plot shows 
the result of shorter and shorter averaging windows.&nbsp; As a result, the 
measurement error increases and the peak broadens for each successive plot going 
from the bottom to the top in Figure 11.&nbsp; 
The plot at the top, with an averaging window of only 80 samples, exhibits the 
most measurement error and the broadest peak.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>(It should be noted, however, that even the spectra for the shorter 
averaging windows have some zero-valued points.&nbsp; Once you understand the 
reason for the zero-valued points, you can correlate the positions of those 
points to the length of the averaging windows in Figure 11.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Impact of spectral measurement errors</b></font></p>
<p>Now I'm going to show you the detrimental impact of such spectral measurement 
errors.&nbsp; In particular, the failure of the average to converge on zero for 
short averaging windows limits the spectral resolution of the Fourier transform.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Five time series with two sinusoids each</b></font></p>
<p>I will create five new time series, each consisting of the sum of two 
sinusoids with fairly closely-spaced frequencies.&nbsp; One sinusoid has 32 
samples per cycle as in Figures 10 and 11.&nbsp; The other sinusoid has 26 
samples per cycle.</p>
<p>As before, the lengths of the individual time series will be 80, 160, 240, 
320, and 400 samples respectively.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Spectral analysis using Fourier transform</b></font></p>
<p>I will perform a Fourier transform on each of the time series in an attempt 
to show that the spectrum of each time series consists of two peaks, with one 
peak 
corresponding to each of the sinusoids added together to create the time series.&nbsp; 
The five spectra are shown in Figure 12.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00108figl.gif" width="409" height="431"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 12 Spectrum of five different time series of different 
lengths</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Discuss the longest time series first</b></font></p>
<p>Once again, let's begin with the plot at the bottom of Figure 12.&nbsp; As 
you can see, this spectrum shows two very distinct spectral peaks.&nbsp; Thus, 
for this amount of frequency separation and a length of 400 samples, the Fourier 
transform did a good job of separating the two peaks.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Resolution for shorter averaging windows</b></font></p>
<p>Moving upward in Figure 12, we see that the Fourier transform on the time 
series with a length of 320 samples <i>(the fourth plot from the top)</i> also did a good job of separating the 
two peaks.</p>
<p>However, separation the process began to deteriorate for&nbsp;lengths of 240 samples 
and 160 samples.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>No peak separation for 80-sample average</b></font></p>
<p>For a length of 80 samples, the two peaks merged 
completely.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>A horizontally-expanded view of the spectra</b></font></p>
<p>Figure 13 shows a horizontally-expanded view of the same spectral data to 
give you a better idea of the structure of the peaks.&nbsp; The plots in Figure 
13 show only the first fifty frequency values.</p>

<p align="center">Figure 13 Spectrum of five different time series of different

<p>You may find it interesting to make a side-by-side comparison of Figures 13 
and 11 in separate browser windows.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Zero-valued points in the spectra</b></font></p>
<p>Before leaving this topic, there are a few more things that I want to show 
you.&nbsp; If you go back and look at the bottom plot in Figure 11, you will 
note an interesting characteristic of that plot.&nbsp; In particular, starting 
at the peak and moving outward in both directions, every second plotted value is 
zero.&nbsp; I'm going to  explain the reason for and the significance of this 
characteristic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>(As I mentioned earlier, there are also zero-valued points in the spectra 
of the time series with the shorter averaging windows.&nbsp; Once you understand 
the reason for the zero-valued points, you can correlate the positions of those 
points to the length of the averaging window.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>400 spectral values were computed</b></font></p>
<p>To begin with, the Fourier transform program that was used to compute this 
spectrum computed 400 values at equally spaced points between zero and the 
folding frequency <i>(only the first 50 values are shown in Figure 11).</i>&nbsp; 
Thus, each of the side-by-side rectangles in Figure 11 represents the spectral 
value computed at one of the 400 frequency points.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Sampling frequency was one sample per second</b></font></p>
<p>The sinusoid that was used as the target for this spectral analysis had 32 
samples per cycle.&nbsp; Since this sinusoid was generated mathematically 
instead of being the result of sampling an analog signal, we can consider the 
sampling frequency to be anything that we want.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For simplicity, let's assume that the sampling frequency was one sample per 
second.&nbsp; This causes the sinusoid to have a period of 32 seconds and a 
frequency of 0.03125 cycles per second.&nbsp; <i>(Remember this number.&nbsp; It 
will be important later.)</i></p>
<p>At a sampling rate of one sample per second, the folding frequency occurs at 
0.5 cycles per second.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The computational frequency interval</b></font></p>
<p>Dividing the folding frequency by 400 we conclude that the Fourier transform 
program computed a spectral value every 0.00125 cycles per second.&nbsp; Given 
that every second spectral value is zero, the zero values occur every 0.00250 
cycles per second.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Let's compute the average of some products</b></font></p>
<p>The top plot in Figure 14 shows the result of multiplying a cosine function 
having a frequency of 0.03125 cycles per second <i>(the frequency of the 
sinusoid in the previous spectral analysis experiment)</i> by a sine function having a 
frequency of 0.02875 cycles per second.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <i>(This replicates one of the steps in the computation of the imaginary value in the Fourier 
transform).</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difference between the  frequencies of the cosine function and the sine 
function is 0.00250 cycles per second.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>(Note that this frequency difference is the reciprocal of the actual number of samples in the 
earlier time series, which contained 400 samples.&nbsp; This is also the 
frequency interval on which the Fourier transform produced zero-valued points 
for the bottom plot in Figure 11.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">

<p align="center">Figure 14 Average values of sinusoid products</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The average of the product time series</b></font></p>
<p>The second plot in Figure 14 shows the average value of the time series in 
the first plot versus the number of samples included in the averaging window.&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
<p> <i>(This replicates another step in the computation of the imaginary value in the Fourier 
transform).</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is very important to note that this average plot goes to zero when 400 
samples are included in the average.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Product of two cosine functions</b></font></p>
<p>Similarly, the third plot in Figure 14 shows the product of the same cosine 
function as above and another cosine function having the same frequency as the 
sine function described above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <i>(This replicates a step in the computation of the real value in the Fourier 
transform).</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The average of the product time series</b></font></p>
<p>The fourth plot in Figure 14 shows the average value of the time series in the third plot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <i>(This replicates another step in the computation of the real value in the Fourier 
transform).</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This average plot goes to zero at an averaging window of about 200 samples, and again at 
an averaging window of 400 samples.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Where do the zero values match?</b></font></p>
<p>The first point at which both average plots go to zero at the same point on the horizontal axis is at an averaging 
window of 400 samples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>(Both the real and imaginary values must go to zero in order 
for the spectral value produced by the Fourier transform to go to zero.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Zero values in the spectrum for a sinusoid</b></font></p>
<p>Thus, the values produced by performing a Fourier transform on a single 
sinusoid go through zero at regular frequency intervals out from the peak in 
both directions.&nbsp; The frequency intervals between the zero values are multiples of the reciprocal of the 
actual length of the sinusoid on which the transform is performed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>(Note however, that you may not see the zero-valued points in the spectrum 
if you don't compute the spectral values at exactly those frequency values.&nbsp; 
This is the case for some of the plots in Figure 11.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The frequency resolution of the Fourier transform</b></font></p>
<p>Some regard the frequency interval equal to the reciprocal of the length of 
the time series as being the useful resolution of the spectrum analysis process.</p>
<p>In other words, two peaks in the spectrum cannot be resolved if the frequency 
difference between them is less than the reciprocal of the length of the time 
series.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Illustration of frequency resolution</b></font></p>
<p>This is illustrated by the plots in Figure 15.&nbsp; Figure 15 is similar to 
Figure 13 with one major difference.&nbsp; In Figure 13, the frequency difference 
between the two sinusoids that made up each of the time series was rather large.&nbsp; In Figure 15, the frequency 
difference between the two sinusoids that made up each of the time series was reduced to 1/400, 
<i>(the reciprocal of 
the length of the longest time series).</i> </p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00108figo.gif" width="409" height="431"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 15 Illustration of frequency resolution</p>
<p>Each plot in Figure 15 shows the first 50 points produced by performing a 
Fourier transform on one of the time series.&nbsp; In each case, the time series 
consisted of the sum of two sinusoids with a frequency separation of 1/400.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>A match for the frequency resolution</b></font></p>
<p>The length of the time series for the bottom plot was 400 samples.&nbsp; 
Thus, the separation of the two sinusoids matched the <i>frequency resolution</i> 
available by performing a Fourier transform on that time series.</p>
<p>As you can see, the two peaks in the spectrum were resolved by the bottom 
plot in Figure 15.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Insufficient frequency resolution</b></font></p>
<p>The other 
four time series were shorter, having lengths of 80, 160, 240, and 320 samples 
respectively, from top to bottom.</p>
<p>The important thing to note in Figure 15 is that the spectrum analysis 
performed on the 
400-sample time series was successful in separating the two peaks.</p>
<p>However, even though the spectrum analysis on the 320-sample time series hinted at a 
separation of the peaks, none of the spectrum analyses on the other four shorter time series 
successfully separated the peaks.</p>
<p>This illustrates that the frequency resolution of the Fourier transform is the 
reciprocal of the length of the time series.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Sufficient resolution in all five cases</b></font></p>
<p>I'm going to show you one more picture and then call it a wrap for this 
lesson.&nbsp; Figure 16 is similar to Figure 15 with one major difference.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="dsp00108figp.gif" width="409" height="431"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 16 Illustration of frequency resolution</p>
<p>As before, the five plots in Figure 16 show the first 50 points produced 
by performing a Fourier transform on five different time series.&nbsp; Starting 
at the top, the lengths of the time series were 80, 160, 240, 320, and 400 
samples.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Adequate frequency resolution in all cases</b></font></p>
<p>Also as before, each time series was the sum of two sinusoids with 
closely-spaced frequencies.&nbsp; However, in Figure 16, the difference between 
the sinusoidal frequencies was different from one time series to the next.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In Figure 16, the frequency difference for the sinusoids contained in each 
time series was the reciprocal of the length of that particular time series.&nbsp; 
Therefore, the frequency difference for each case matched the frequency 
resolution of the Fourier transform.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The frequency difference was achieved by ...</b></font></p>
<p>The frequency of the lower-frequency peak was the same in all five cases.&nbsp; 
Therefore, this peak should line up vertically for the five plots in Figure 16.</p>
<p>The frequency difference between the sinusoids was achieved by increasing the 
higher frequency by an amount equal to the reciprocal of the length of the time 
series.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Peaks were resolved in all five cases</b></font></p>
<p>If you examine Figure 16, you will see that the peaks corresponding to the 
two sinusoids were resolved for all five time series.</p>
<p>As would be expected, the peaks appear to be broader for the shorter time 
series having the lower frequency resolution.</p>

<h2>
<a NAME="Summary"></a>Summary</h2></center>
<p>This lesson has presented a completely non-mathematical discussion of issues 
involving the averaging of time series, and the impact of those issues on 
spectrum analysis.</p>
<p>Those averaging issues have an impact on other areas of DSP as well, but the 
detrimental effect is probably more obvious in spectrum analysis than in other areas.</p>
