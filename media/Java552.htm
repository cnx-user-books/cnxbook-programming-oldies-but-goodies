 Students in Prof. Baldwin's <b><u>Advanced Java Programming</u></b> classes 
at ACC are responsible for knowing and understanding all of the material in
this lesson.

<h2><a name="introduction"></a><font color="#ff0000">Introduction</font></h2>
</center>
 Every computer attached to an <b>IP </b>network has a unique four-byte (32-bit)
address.  
<p>For human consumption, we usually convert each of the four bytes to an
unsigned decimal value and display them connected by periods to make them
easier to remember. As of this writing, the <b>IP </b>address of <b>www.javasoft.com</b> 
is <b>204.160.241.98</b>.  </p>
<p>What do we mean when we speak of <b>www.javasoft.com</b>?  </p>
<p>Each <b>IP </b>address has a corresponding name known as a <i>domain name</i>.
The <i>domain name</i> for the <b>IP </b>address <b>204.160.241.98</b> is
<b>www.javasoft.com</b>.  </p>
<p>For example, I can enter either of these into the <i>Location</i> field 
of my Netscape Navigator program and use it to connect to the JavaSoft site. 
 </p>
<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) was developed to translate between <b>IP </b>addresses
and domain names. Whenever you log your browser onto the internet and attempt
to connect to a server using its <i>domain name</i>, the browser first communicates
with a DNS server to learn the corresponding numeric <b>IP </b>address. The
numeric <b>IP </b>address is encapsulated into the data packets and used
by the internet protocol to route those packets from the source to the destination. 
 </p>
<p>We will learn how to use the Java <b>InetAddress </b>class to find the 
<i>domain name </i>corresponding to an <b>IP </b>address, and to find the 
<b>IP </b>address corresponding to a <i>domain name</i> in our sample program 
for this lesson.  </p>
<p>We will also learn how to use the methods of the <b>InetAddress </b>class 
to obtain information about the address of the <i>local host</i>. </p>
<center>
<h2><a name="sample program"></a><font color="#ff0000">Sample Program</font></h2>
</center>
 This program exercises several of the methods of the <b>InetAddress </b>class. 
 
<p>You must be logged onto an appropriate network for this program to run 
properly. Otherwise, it will throw an exception of type <b>UnknownHostException</b>. 
 </p>
<p>This program was tested using JDK 1.1.3 under Win95.  </p>
<p>The output from one run of this program was as follows. Note that because 
I use a commercial ISP that assigns an <b>IP </b>address to me each time I
log on, the output will be different each time I log onto the ISP and run
this program.  </p>
<p>As you can see from the boldface line below, after determining the <b>IP 
</b>address that has been assigned to me for a particular logon session, a
reverse lookup on that <b>IP </b>address provides the domain name of the
ISP. On this particular occasion, the domain name of the ISP was <b>slip129-37-120-182.tx.us.ibm.net</b>. 
<br>
&nbsp;

 We will look at these lines of output in context as we review the different 
parts of this program. </p>
<center>
<h3><a name="code fragments"></a><font color="#ff0000">Code Fragments</font></h3>
</center>
 All of the code in this program is contained in the <b>main()</b> method. 
I will ignore the exception handling code during this discussion. You will 
find that code in the program listing in the next section.  
<p>The <b>InetAddress </b>class provides objects that you can use to manipulate 
and deal with <b>IP </b>addresses and <i>domain names</i>. However, you don't
instantiate those objects directly. Rather, the class provides several <b>static
</b>methods that return an object of type <b>InetAddress</b>.  </p>
<p>The <b>static getByName(String host)</b> method returns an <b>InetAddress 
</b>object representing the host passed as a parameter. This method can be
used to determine the <b>IP </b>address of a host, given the host's name.
The host name can either be a machine name, such as "java.sun.com", or a
string representing its <b>IP </b>address, such as "206.26.48.100".  </p>
<p>The <b>getAllByName(String host)</b> method returns an array of <b>InetAddress 
</b>objects. This method can be used to determine all the <b>IP </b>addresses 
of the specified host.  </p>
<p>The <b>getLocalHost()</b> method returns an <b>InetAddress </b>object representing
the local host computer.  </p>
<p>Our first code fragment obtains an <b>InetAddress </b>object representing 
a particular server and displays that address using the overridden <b>toString() 
</b>method of the <b>InetAddress </b>class. As indicated earlier, the output 
produced by this code fragment was <b>www2.austin.cc.tx.us/198.213.3.13</b>. 
<br>
&nbsp; 
<table border="1" bgcolor="#ffff80">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; InetAddress address = InetAddress.<b>getByName</b>(<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "www2.austin.cc.tx.us");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println(address);</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
 The next code fragment does a <u>reverse lookup</u> on this <b>IP </b>address 
and displays the result. As mentioned above, the <b>getByName()</b> method 
can accept either the name of the server or the <b>IP </b>address of the server
<u>as a string</u>.  </p>
<p>This code fragment does some string manipulation on the result of the previous
code fragment to construct a string containing the numeric portion of the
previous result. This string representation of the numeric <b>IP </b>address
is then passed to the <b>getByName()</b> method to produce the following
result: <b>ella.austin.cc.tx.us/198.213.3.13</b>.  </p>
<p>Although I can't explain why, it is interesting to note that the <b>ella</b> 
portion of the string returned by this method was not included in the name 
originally used to obtain the <b>IP </b>address.  </p>
<p>It is also interesting to note that if the <b>ella</b> portion is included 
in the name, my Netscape browser is unable to resolve an <b>IP </b>address 
for the server. <br>
&nbsp; 
<table border="1" bgcolor="#ffff80">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int temp = address.toString().indexOf('/');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; address = InetAddress.<b>getByName</b>(<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; address.toString().substring(temp+1));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println(address);</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
09/05/03 Note that the code shown above required the following modification 
to run under SDK 1.4.2.<br>
</p>
<pre>      int temp = address.toString().indexOf('/');<br>      address = InetAddress.getByName(<br>                     address.toString().substring(temp+1));<br>// Required update for v1.4.2<br>//      System.out.println(address);<br>System.out.println(address.getHostName());</pre>
<p><br>
</p>
<p> The terminology <b>localhost </b>is used to describe the local computer 
on which this program is running. When connected to an <b>IP </b>network, 
the local computer must have an <b>IP </b>address. This is accomplished in
a variety of ways. The following discussion is based on a computer that is
used to dial into a commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP).  </p>
<p>My ISP has reserved a large block of <b>IP </b>addresses to be shared by
its many customers. Whenever I dial in and log onto the server, one of those
<b>IP </b>addresses is assigned to my connection for the duration of that
logon session. If I disconnect and log on again, the probability is high
that the <b>IP </b>address assigned for the second session will be different
from the one assigned for the first session.  </p>
<p>Other situations may be different. For example, if your computer is one
of a network of computers in a company, your company may have reserved a
block of <b>IP </b>addresses and may have assigned one of those addresses 
to your computer on a "permanent" basis. In that case, you should get the 
same address each time you run this program.  </p>
<p>It is also possible to get your own "permanent" <b>IP</b> address and domain
name.  </p>
<p>In any event, the <b>getLocalHost()</b> method can be used to obtain an
<b>InetAddress </b>object that represents the computer on which the program
is being run. This is illustrated by the following code fragment. This code
fragment produced the following output: <b>baldwin/129.37.120.182</b>.  </p>
<p>In this case, the numeric portion of the output was the <b>IP </b>address 
that was assigned to me for a particular logon session with my ISP.  </p>
<p>I'm confident that <b>baldwin</b> did not come from the DNS server, but
rather is the name by which my operating system (Win95) recognizes my computer.
Apparently the overridden <b>toString()</b> method obtained this system parameter
and used it to construct the string for display. <br>
&nbsp; 
<table border="1" bgcolor="#ffff80">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; address = InetAddress.<b>getLocalHost()</b>;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println(address);</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
 The next code fragment uses the <b>getByName()</b> method to do a reverse 
lookup on the numeric portion of the output from the previous code fragment. 
In particular, this code fragment determines the name by which the DNS server
recognizes this numeric address. The output from the code fragment was: <b>slip129-37-120-182.tx.us.ibm.net/129.37.120.182</b>. 
 </p>
<p>As you can see, I am a customer of a commercial ISP venture of IBM corporation 
commonly referred to as ibm.net.  </p>
<p>It is interesting (and somewhat contradictory to the earlier discussion 
about <b>ella)</b> to note that I can install and run a web server on my computer,
and access that server using the portion of the above result to the left
of the "/" in the Netscape Navigator <i>Location</i> field (actually, I have
to modify it each time I log onto the ISP to correspond to the name returned
for that session). In other words, I can use the <i>domain name</i> provided
by a reverse lookup on the temporary <b>IP </b>address to log onto a server
on my computer.  </p>
<p>There are some other interesting peculiarities as well, but they are too
complicated to discuss here. I will leave it as an exercise for the student
to do this type of experimentation on your own. You will obtain enough simple
programs in this series of lessons to do this type of experimentation, including
a program for a simple web server that you can install on your computer. <br>
&nbsp; 
<table border="1" bgcolor="#ffff80">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; temp = address.toString().indexOf('/');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; address = InetAddress.<b>getByName</b>(<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; address.toString().substring(temp+1));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println(address);</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
 Once you have an <b>InetAddress </b>object, there are other useful methods 
of the <b>InetAddress </b>class that you can invoke on that object. For example,
the following code fragment invokes the <b>getHostName()</b> method on the
object and produces the following output: <b>slip129-37-120-182.tx.us.ibm.net</b>. 
<br>
&nbsp; 
<table border="1" bgcolor="#ffff80">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println(address.<b>getHostName()</b>);</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
 Similarly, the following code fragment invokes the <b>getAddress()</b> method
on the object to produce an array of bytes containing the <b>IP </b>address.
In this case, the code fragment displays: <b>129 37 120 182</b>.  </p>
<p>Because there is no such thing as an unsigned byte in Java, converting 
the array of bytes into something that can be displayed in a meaningful way
requires some manipulation of the bytes as shown in the code fragment. <br>
&nbsp; 
<table border="1" bgcolor="#ffff80">

    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; byte[] bytes = address.<b>getAddress()</b>;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for(int cnt = 0; cnt &lt; bytes.length; cnt++){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int uByte =&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bytes[cnt] &lt; 0 ? bytes[cnt] + 256 : bytes[cnt];<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.print(uByte + " ");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }//end for loop</pre>
